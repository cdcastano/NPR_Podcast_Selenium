Podcast? This is my favorite NPR radio show,05/01/2019,Page Larkin,"Podcast? This is my favorite NPR radio show
re-packaged as a so called “Podcast”
Love Fresh Air and Terry Gross.",5
Automatic Download,05/01/2019,evg.bones,Dozens of this podcast were just downloaded to my library without my say so. A gigantic pain to delete every single one.,1

What happened to Code Switch??,04/30/2019,FEAU,Apple Podcasts took my Code Switch subscription and wrapped it into Fresh Air without any warning! How disappointing - a bit of a heads up regarding the restructuring would have gone a long way. I’ve unsubscribed-I don’t have the mental bandwidth for all that Fresh Air covers-but I will finish listening to the Code Switch episodes I had downloaded before the merger. Peace.,5
Appreciate you!,04/25/2019,PNW boomer,"As Gene says often “I appreciate you”! Thank you for a “woke” podcast that informs with interesting interviews and commentaries. As a 57-year-old mixed race woman, I have learned so much I did t know I needed to know (like what woke means). I get educated without having to embarrass myself with what are probably basic questions (also didn’t know Latinx and cis-gender or the explanatory comma for that matter!) I keep listening hoping I might be considered woke one day by my young brothers and sisters.",5
Always Insightful,04/24/2019,nadi624,"This is easily my favorite podcast. I've been listening from the beginning and have enjoyed 99% of the episodes and always look forward to each one. Hard to pick faves but I especially appreciated the one about black characters in horror movies. I am a fan of the genre but the analysis provided by the professor on the topic was mind-blowing and made me think, ""Of course! It all makes sense!"" Now her observations seem so obvious. There are also others like the one about the explanatory comma. I enjoyed that one and didn't really think much about it and was surprised to hear how much some people felt strongly against it. It's really helpful when this kind of information is shared because even though it can be somewhat jarring to hear about backlash to something you don't think is controversial AT ALL, it helps you understand where others are coming from though this is also in large part to a great production team. As for some constructive feedback, use fewer academics. As good as they often are, there are other experts out there.",5
Best ever Podcast!,04/10/2019,alistarharris,"Y’all blow my mind every time. Your stories are informative, timely, real and infused with respect and dignity. Thank you for making podcast about race, identity and culture that represents our larger black and brown identities real and dope. I appreciate you. #codeswitchisdope",5
667: Wartime Radio,04/10/2019,Racq the Belle,"This episode was well done and I enjoyed it, but LOL at Ira saying “I guess that’s what America does these days; make people work for free,” as if America doesn’t have a long history of slavery.",5
Episode on how to talk about Israel,04/05/2019,ernchamp,I was presently surprised with the balance of the episode . You guys did an excellent job of addressing why it’s so dangerous for some ... (not me) to criticize the human rights violations and other issues involving Israel . Good work folks,4
Great Podcast!,02/09/2019,Lyntwhit,"I just listened to my first episode, Pretty Hurts. It was a great listen. Looking forward to hearing more!",5

Best podcast,02/16/2019,MCFZS,"I have been listening since the first episode aired. Brilliant, deep, messy conversations about race that somehow stays funny and fun.
Subscribe. Listen. Learn.",5
"Excellent and vital, especially for white people like me",02/16/2019,kcinspb,"Code switch provides a vital discussion of the issues of the day which are influenced by racial dynamics. I enjoy the hosts and their interaction, but the best parts are their guests and the nuanced discussion of life in the US for people of color.",5
"Thoughtful, courageous & Smart.",02/20/2019,Needle Diamond,"Sometimes uncomfortable always thoughtful and engaging.

Gene needs to work on his sexism,02/25/2019,Mamaknitty,"There is a huge controversy going on in the knitting community right now and the story was pitched to code switch and Gene dismissed them as some girl thing not worthy of the gum on his shoe. He mocked them and was very rude. women of color are having a very real discussion about racism that effects thier lives, business and thier voices. Shame on code switch for participating in such a blatent display of sexism",1
"thoughtful, well said, makes me think!!",03/03/2019,Morah1,"ive only listened to a few episodes so far, and i already love it. before i listened, i saw a lot of angry one star reviews about the first episode; I now know that those reviews are probably just angry yt people who are uncomfortable talking about their race as an “identity.” As a white jewish-american woman, I love these types of conversations, even IF they make me uncomfortable. sometimes, it’s okay to be uncomfortable. this is DEFINITELY one of those times!!",5
Amazing!,03/06/2019,SophiaHolly,This is a vital podcast ❤️,5
Great,03/17/2019,DBrown2019,One of my favorite podcasts. I love how they mix history with current news and educate in a non-preachy way. We need more of these conversations.,5
SF State Episode,03/24/2019,gal_wonder,Thank you for the episode about San Francisco State. I grew up in the Bay Area and lived in SF for a decade and never knew this piece of its history in such depth. Proud of the place I still call home.,4
Vegans,03/28/2019,Carlitos9,"I loved that you talked about vegans from other cultures as a Colombian vegan, im keeping my traditions but leaving meat out or using vegan meat and cheeses.",5
Love this podcast!,03/28/2019,Haunani31,I just binged 5 episodes and l’m hooked. Great research from the facilitators and guests. This show does not addresses race but it does not camp out in victim hood. Excellent conversation starter.,5
Great Pod!,03/29/2019,Eaglefox20,Excellent pod that covers hard to talk about racial issues. Content skews toward issues facing African Americans. I would like to see more content facing other races.,5
"Mostly Love It, But...",03/31/2019,lady luvvvva,"I’m disappointed that there was never any focus on Black islands hit by hurricanes. Additionally, sometimes, I feel like Shereen is reaching.",3
Good but could be better,04/02/2019,Saro11215,"Really interesting podcast with valuable insights. Great job uncovering the day-to-day impact of racism in America, and helping listeners understand how and why endemic racism exists and how its unfairness manifests in our society. Still, I think the podcast could take more risks.",3
A POC perspective on race in America,12/12/2018,thundershower,"I’m so happy this show exists. Some of the episodes are really rewarding and shed light on perspectives that don’t get much airtime on traditional media outlets. I loved the stories about whiteness, the series following the school for black boys in DC, and the many segments about the immigrant experience. I don’t subscribe to the podcast anymore, however, because a few too many episodes were too upsetting. One that immediately comes to mind had a segment comparing sound advice regarding sharing expenses based on actual finances to a cynical take on restorative justice (in my opinion) where the white partner has to pay more as some sort of white tax. More upsetting, the episode on Civil War monuments presented a “he said/she said” narrative comparing an opinion based on the actual history of the Civil War to one steeped in the Lost Cause narrative — the latter being a widely discredited attempt at historical revisionism that occludes the true motivations of the war. Some of the statements the source said — that the Civil War was not about slavery but conflict between Northern English Americans versus Southern Scotch-Irish Americans — were just clearly untrue and I don’t understand how the producers didn’t catch that.",3
The podcast that talks about talking about race,12/12/2018,JymmiWynn,"Code Switch - the podcast that talks about talking about race issues while saying nothing. You name the subject, Code Switch will make it about race - even dogs.",1
Keep it 100!,12/14/2018,codeswitchday1,Don’t let the haters get you down Code Switch Team! Best podcast out here and they have the discussions others refuse to touch.,5
Always thought provoking and at times entertaining and cathartic,12/19/2018,MPAnon,"One of my favorite discoveries of 2018! The lens through which they discuss issues is truly refreshing, especially for NPR (which is a well intended organization but like everything heavily dominated by white male perspectives). I don’t agree with all their tales and I LIKE that. Growth comes from both challenge and affirmation. Do yourself a favor and make this a weekly download.",5
Critical Race Theory: the Podcast,12/22/2018,Standpoor,"I'm a liberal, atheist, Middle Eastern gay man, and I'd rather stand first row at a Trump rally than be locked in a room with these feaux woke narcissists.",1
Love this podcast,12/26/2018,podsforwren,"I just love code switch. You all speak my language! And amazing job on the DNA episode, giving us all different perspectives on the controversial topic.",5
Critical and caring podcasr,12/26/2018,AlejandroES,"I admire how they illustrate the complex role that race plays in our everyday lives and hxstories. I also appreciate the diversity of topics that they talk about in relation to race and that they bring people/professionals to talk about such topics. Lastly, I love how much I can relate to the the curators of the podcast and the way they facilitate the podcast is funny, critical, and easy to follow. Overall, this podcast is critical, urgent, funny, and loving.",5
The wide range of reviews speak for itself,12/28/2018,Rosunitiner,"Tough topic. Any subjects about race gender and/or socio-economic status is uncomfortable. The podcast is designed to make you more self aware, which is supposed to be a bit uncomfortable.",4
Always a good listen,12/28/2018,Jacqueline531,"I pull up Code Switch frequently, and I appreciate the many ways the hosts dissect race, intersectionality, and go deep in a variety of ways. I’ve been known to share this podcast with friends and colleagues, and I appreciate the courage to tackle the ways race is lived, felt, and discussed in America and beyond. Keep up the good work.",5
Thoughtful discussion of race,12/31/2018,nymoonvirgo,"Always helpful, thoughtful, researched, nuanced, and straightforward reporting and discussions of race in America - in politics, culture, education, commerce, etc. So grateful for the work you all do to illuminate the issues.",5

HBCU❤️,01/10/2019,HBCU❤️,As a African American female in the corporate world it is hard to find words for your experience. I think this is a positive podcast that sheds light on a unique experience hopefully enlightening others who are different! Ultimately I hope that is what we all try to do one day!!!,5

Important topic very poor execution,01/29/2019,danndaze,"A lot of bashing and loving this one. I’ll start off by saying that the conversation topics discussed are so important, and I am ecstatic that a lot of the tough issues around race in America are discussed. I am (for the record) a first generation Hispanic with a bi-racial and bi-cultural fiancé (Mexican and Arabic).",1
The best podcast show,01/30/2019,Illhaus,I learn so much every time. Thank you for challenging and growing your listeners. We love evolving!,5
A different perspective,01/31/2019,APL URL,"S&G have helped me understand a different point of view and appreciate the triumphs and struggles of others. Thank you! As a new Boo, this podcast gives things to think about and talk about with my Bae.",5
Pretty Hurts,02/02/2019,JonesE3,Really disappointed in the lack of representation for other women of color concerning this topic! Is this show only representing one POC group now?? Recent episodes seem to be dominated by issues concerning the Latin X community. Is this evidence of sloppy work or divisions amongst POC?,5
Great Podcast!,02/05/2019,Tamarab1980,"Love the way the hosts bring in so many perspectives. This show is refreshing, thought provoking, and powerful. Thank you for giving a much needed platform to so many voices.",5

Top Five Podcast - Incisive and Insightful,09/10/2018,trdollar77,"Gene Demby and Shareen Marisol Miraji do an excellent job of bring to the forefront current and past histories, both social and personal, that directly confront racism in the US and elsewhere. They create incredible dialog that is thought provoking, informative, and that make warm and break hearts. Beyond being entertaining, it's a great 25-35 minutes every week that expand my perspective on how the world operates for people of different backgrounds and how people have to navigate the world built around them, one in which the do not have input.",5
Love this!,09/12/2018,GinaS11582,"A poignant, always new look at how race plays into daily life, in big ways and small. A must listen for the “woke” and not so woke especially! This white girl has learned a lot.",5
Trash,09/25/2018,bronsexual21,It’s not good I’m only listening because I am being forced to don’t waste your time with it.,1
Gene & Shereen are amazing,10/06/2018,Husl2014,"I’m always impressed by thoughtful treatment of complex issues, the humor, and the intelligence that these two offer. Because they bring on scholars and experts, I feel like I’m being informed, this is the true form of journalism. Often when people talk about race they try so hard to be “neutral” that they end up being dishonest about the realities of race in this country. I also love the “what’s bringing you life” music at the end of each episode, I’ve added several new artist to my list as a result of this show.",5
Best Podcast,10/20/2018,Jessi Jamz,I jump w joy every time there is new episode. Listen and get into it!!!,5
So good! Never oversimplified but really enjoyable,10/23/2018,csssssv,Loved the PR episode and the recent episodes on adoptees. New voices. New topics like genetic testing. Fresh perspective.,5
Gene Demby's Voice Ruins It,10/24/2018,ray210,"I find it hard to listen to Demby's voice: a voice so garbled shouldn't be speaking at machine-gun place. Gene, we know you're smart, but slow it down. Your voice should do gravitas — not ""arch.""",2
I listen to several & this one is one of the best,10/28/2018,BethFWTX,Completely appreciate how open & honest (and genuine) this host is. Some of her self-disclosures surprise me but good for her for role-modeling (while she walks the walk). Interesting & challenging. Thanks!,5
Keep it up!,10/31/2018,Tsch621,I appreciate the realness/casual-self exposed and conversations that being had and then shared on air for others. Keep it up!,5
Doctoral seminar series on the toxicity of Whiteness,11/06/2018,chrisathorn,Critically important reporting that helps shine a light on the dark places in American society that need power washing. The range of topics points to the omnipresence of oppression. Keep up the great work.,5

Disturbing,11/19/2018,Poppepin,Hateful,1
"Okay, but factually biased",11/29/2018,8ude,"Just listened to the episode about dogs. Lots of pro-pit bull propaganda, couched in criticism of white people.",3
Gene's Cadence is the Worst,11/30/2018,SDSSTL,"The cadence of Gene Denby's voice is EXTREMELY difficult to listen to. I'd love to know if this bothers other listeners as well. I don't know where Gene picked this up at, but he pauses at odd moments within sentences, and then speeds up the rest of the words and says them reallyreallyreally fast ALLATONCE. Is this a ""broadcast voice"" thing? Is it a thing he does to sound more knowledgable? Younger? Cooler? Aaah, please stop! I can't even handle it when he guest-hosts on other NPR podcasts (Pop Culture Happy Hour, for one).",2
A great listen,07/18/2018,pddoc2,"I really appreciate this podcast for the provocative and timely topics, thoughtfully analyzed and discussed. Thank you!",5

Incredible discussions at the touch of a button,08/06/2018,RWine :),"I LOVE Code Switch!! As a Japanese-American from a rural town in Northern California, I did not begin having these discussions until I went to college two years ago. This podcast has enhanced my journey into learning about and discussing topics in identity and race. I can’t get enough of this team and the work they do. YOU ROCK!",5
Regular listener,08/06/2018,RosaCole,"Every week I learn about the experiences of folks who are not like me: that is very important to me and shapes how I move through the world.

"Insightful, thoughtful, funny, heart-wrenching",08/10/2018,22on7,My only complaint is that the episodes don’t drop more often. Really great podcast where in-depth analysis from thoughtful people is the norm. Keep up the great work!,5
Try it and you see why I love it,08/12/2018,CoolioChicken,This is one of my core podcasts that I wait for every week. The nuance and the honesty and the sound of people of color talking about their experiences and real things that effect people is quite refreshing. This podcast tells people’s stories and gives them context and voices and legitimacy in a world that is content to stay deaf to them.,5
amazing,08/14/2018,musictycoon,keep the good fight and the good work friends,5
Connecting through difference,08/15/2018,QueerGal,"I am a news/podcast/learning junky. I’ve been listening to Code Switch since its first episode. I routinely learn new things, maybe about something I already knew, but from a different perspective that enriches my understanding. There is something amazing about how they talk about race, ethnicity, culture, etc., that creates connection.",5
"Interesting, intellectually stimulating & needed",08/16/2018,Lololovesskiing,"I've started to binge listen back through episodes even if the title doesn't seem interesting to me at first, I've found that episode will be regardless. I love the different angles and intense level of research they have put into this podcast. You're doing great work and my brain is happily stimulated.",5
Interesting,08/21/2018,Blacksunhc,"I find this podcast interesting, however I’d like to see more discussion of how different minorities live with each other successfully.",4

Thought-provoking and well done,08/23/2018,SDlibn,"Very well done - high quality production, high quality investigative journalism, high quality storytelling. Every episode has made me think about the world a little differently.

Because of Code Switch, I feel like I understand my own country better.",5
Terrific!,05/04/2018,GracieJoy66,"As usual NPR puts out an excellent pod. I went back and listened to all episodes and it was so current and well produced,",5
I feel seen,05/08/2018,あれあれ君,And look forward para cada podcast that helps me learn how fellow communities are doing and how mine has been shaped: peep those episodios de “Hispanos”,5
Mix it up,05/09/2018,Mimi Ak.,"I can’t explain how happy I was when I found this podcast. It’s been a great oasis to retreat to and dwell more diverse American experiences, an experiences more like my own. I do have one hang up. The topics and guests seem to focus on the same general minority groups. I know the hosts’ personal stories and current events will in inevitably influence the stories, but can we mix up a bit? I’m sure there are stories from other less know minority groups that deserve the light. I may be biased, I’m Afro-Caribbean from a non-Latin country, but I thought Code Switch was about race and identity in general. It would be nice to hear about a wider range of indigenous, immigrant and diaspora experiences, and even more nuanced representation of the Black American experience. Otherwise keep up the great work!",4
Insightful and much needed discussions,05/09/2018,NurseSchrcaso,"This most recent episode is an awesome conversation about parenting! I feel like I need to send this to every parent I know, and to shout from the rooftops that these tough conversations can be had in a respectful and curious manner! Well done, Code Switch. Keep on being awesome.",5
Weekly CodeSwitch Fix,05/12/2018,MrsVIzquierdo,I love this podcast! A MUST listen to on a weekly basis. The podcast touches upon a variety of topics and issues brings ALL the voices to the table!,5
My favorite podcast,05/22/2018,lindsaylistens,"My only criticism of Code Switch is it’s TOO SHORT! I could listen to y’all forever and am constantly waiting for the next Tuesday episode to come out. Thanks for the insightful discussions that delve deep into challenging issues of race and society, but still leave room for humor and joy. Everyone should listen to this show!",5
Conquistadors and Pueblos,05/23/2018,Wren Black,I’m listening to this and crying. I am not an immigrant. I am not black. I am descended from the original culture of Northern New Mexico but I was raised in the east and have almost no connections to my culture. This episode is giving me life!,5
This episode is racially insensitive and condescending!,05/25/2018,lasergirlnm,"I have tries to listen to the episode “Of Bloodlines and Conquistadors”, and I was appalled at the racial insensitive and condescension of the two women who were chosen to narrate. Neither of them were respectful of the religious beliefs and traditions of the people interviewed. They laughed, expressed disbelief in certain aspects of the Fiesta de Santa Fe, and didn’t even try to pronounce some of the words correctly. This episode was not and is not worthy of your show and is a huge insult to the native peoples and to the Hispano of northern New Mexico.",1
Amazing,06/19/2018,Lalalalalalisha,"I love this podcast. Theyre so well informed, present multiple sides and different ethnic views. Sometimes im sad episodes are so short, but always very informative. I dont always have time to read so listening in the car is my go-to!",5
Love these topics,06/21/2018,Scuba Steph,I’m so passionate about these topics. Especially being black raised by white parents. I have predominately white friends/coworkers but I feel very different being black. I believe the world perceives me differently then the ones around me. This podcast has helped me see that the issues I think about are not just my own personal observations but true and legit situations. I don’t often feel as if I can speak freely about my opinions. This podcast offers affirmation and allows me to rant and stand on my soapbox in my car while I’m listening!!,5
Great perspective-providing show,06/29/2018,Erin79705,"I’m a professional white woman and I care a great deal about the people who make up this country—all the people. It hasn’t always been easy to find, to hear, and to understand the perspectives of folks from other places in the country, especially because I’m not living in a major urban area; but this podcast helps bridge the divide for me. I can’t help but hope that our collective futures are gonna be better because podcasts like this one make it easier to learn and to think about tough issues confronting us all. Stay woke!",5
Intelligent & informative take on race,07/01/2018,Spicy Bubbles,"I find this show to be a very eye-opening, and at times very moving, take on race. Gene and Shereen are great hosts and help to make the information presented accessible and relatable. The whole team is great, really. There is not a weak link amongst them.",5
Summer Vacatiin,07/04/2018,nevaskin,I really enjoy and learn from listening to your podcast. As an estitichian and concerned environmentalist I approve of recommending sunscreen. But not all sunscreens are alike. Please recommend sunscreens that are ecologically friendly and toxic free.This is really important for the health of our coral reefs and Sun screens that could be potentially be toxic to human skin.,5

The problem in this country,07/10/2018,LionDing,"This is a PRIME example of the problems we have in this great country. Totally the wrong discussion. If you want to look backwards, rather than forward...this is the podcast for you",1
Important for all !!,07/12/2018,clairehubs,"As a white person, this podcast is so important to understanding the challenges minorities face, and I believe this understanding makes me much more empathetic to anyone’s hidden struggles. Thank you for this show, it’s one EVERYONE should hear at least once.",5
Thought provoking but often disappointing,07/13/2018,Opussama,"I've been listening to this podcast since it's inception and have learned a great deal. The show teaches details and true feelings of individuals who are usually not represented in mainstream society. But sometimes I feel like there's a hidden agenda and even a level of unprofessional bias. For example, the episode ""Members of whose tribe?"" took the very strong opinion of one person and used that to express a false and biased reality for all Jews. This was unprofessional journalism in my opinion and it was hurtful.",3
nprnerd4life,07/14/2018,nprnerd4life,This show makes me so happy. Just by listening I feel heard. Seen. Represented. Y'all are my people! Thank you!!,5

"No, don’t change a thing.",02/27/2018,Ally Means,"Stay exactly the way you are I get plenty of CONservative voices on every other media I listen to. I add emphasis on the “con” because the current voices and leaders that are CONservative are con artists, they preach nothing of their original values and I’d rather not hear that on this podcast. Don’t change a thing.",5

Making Sense of a Challenging World,03/05/2018,mightyatom,"Code Switch is essential listening for anyone seeking to understand and navigate the complex issues of race that we all — ragardless of race or ethncity — encounter daily. It's thoughtful, smart, accessible, never preachy. It's helped provide clarity when I'm grappling with something, and insight into how behaviors, actions, and culture affect others.",5
Favorite Podcast,03/06/2018,Heidie A,"I love this podcast for its ability to be informative on topics/specific subject matter that is often overlooked by our pop culture. It's relevant, insightful, and extremely well researched. Such amazing production; the entire team clearly puts a ton of work into every episode, from the initial concept down to the editing. My mindsets have so often been challenged in the questions they bring up and the dialogue is succinct but incredibly in depth. I cannot emphasize enough how grateful I am for how this show has opened my mind-I start way too many sentences with, ""I was listening to this podcast the other day..."" followed by what I've been processing from Codeswitch. Keep up the fantastic work!",5
Great pod with all the feels and good info too,03/06/2018,lucindalynn,Fan since the beginning. Doing great work. Just heard the story of Miriam and her family. Well done. Thank you.,5

THE BEST,03/09/2018,Nickiioo,"I have been lsitening to Code Switch for about 2 years, great journalism and fun episodes and topics.

Very important podcast for the culture THANK YOU GUYS",5
This podcast got me into listening to podcasts,03/10/2018,Pink_Leader,"Code Switch is a valuable voice in the current era, approaching topics that I’ve never carefully considered, as a white woman. I’m so appreciative of Gene and Shireen for each episode for opening my eyes, and for the looks into a variety of lives often ignored. The first episode on Whiteness should be required listening, and the episodes around Philando Castile are essential to understanding the state of race in the US.",5
Every episode is worth your time,01/20/2018,ForTheLoveLover,"I learn so much from each episode. The reporting and storytelling are top-notch, and I can tell that the hosts are deeply passionate about the issues raised in each episode.

Always fascinating,01/24/2018,Ototototo,"Love Gene and Shereen's radio chemistry - always feels like I'm listening to two friends being honest and transparent with each other (even though I'm sure they have a lot more they'd like to say about certain topics that are not fit for NPR!). I especially enjoyed the multi-episode series about Ron Brown High, and hope that Code Switch can do something like that again to really dig into their stories. Never have come across a Code Switch episode I didn't like.",5
Best Podcast on Race/Ethnicity/Culture,01/24/2018,Jagzier,Codeswitch is excellent and balanced journalism on issues of race and ethnicity in our culture. I love that they share opposing views to help bring broader perspective to issues that are highly relevant to our current culture.,5
A+,01/24/2018,lmr1977,"Gripping and thoughtful discussions and reporting with great hosts in Gene Denby and Shereen Marisol Maraji, who bring warmth, wit, incisive analysis, and a necessary sense of urgency to every episode. I was particularly grateful for the recent episode “The R-word in the age of Trump,” and how critically it engaged with journalism in general and NPR in particular.",5
Important,01/24/2018,Dilly5555,"Codeswitch team,

I’m not sure I would never claim to be woke as a state of being but after listening to the “R-word in the age of Trump” episode I’m a little less sleepy now. Hearing racism discussed in terms of harm versus character, defining where terms like bigotry and stereotype exist in relation to each other, and how racial language creates tough questions in this age of journalism was really...intense? Powerful? I can’t find the right word to encompass the fact that I kept rewinding this episode over and over to hear it again. I feel better equipped to understand, discuss, and identify racism and racial animus than I was yesterday in a way that fundamentally changes the conversation for me. I admit that it had never occurred to me that using racism as a descriptor of a perpetrators character without discussing the context of harm was itself racist. I am truly happy to have been exposed to this and the codeswitch team has a listener fr life after today. Thank you for the work that you do here.",5
A very important contribution,01/25/2018,Devi-chan,"So often melanin-deficient folx like me are told ""Hey, sit down and just listen!"" This is a fantastic place to sit down, just listen, and learn about the experiences of PoC in our culture.

“I am a story.”,01/26/2018,Ocean's mama,"“I am a story.” It’s what we all are and it’s time to stop, ask and listen. Love this podcast so much. I am learning, leaning into the discomfort of having been complicit in oppression, and striving to become part of the solution.",5
Smart and Thoughtful Commentary,01/27/2018,Sweetn230,"Code Switch has some of the best commentary and reporting out there when it comes to the intersection of identity, politics, culture, and attitudes. This is what’s needed right now.",5
Why I listen to code switch,01/29/2018,Dinahfitz,I may be too late for this review but as a 50 something white woman who lives in the south I listen because I believe I am never too old to learn and grow. I refuse to let my location or age or skin color define me. I want to be as aware and “woke” ( I hesitate describing myself that way. Seems more authentic if it came from a POC that knows me) as I can possibly be. Code Switch helps me see issues from the perspectives of those in which they most matter. Thank you for teaching me something every time I listen.,5
"On point, informative, challenging",01/31/2018,MrsAdk,So thankful for this podcast and the issues it addresses. Gives me hope in the midst of crazy times.,5

Code Switched,02/08/2018,Jenny_W,"This was the first podcast that really grabbed me and made me want to be late to work. I appreciate that the episodes are around 30 minutes- perfect for my commute or getting ready in the mornings. I love the way social issues are discussed, in such a way that I have been examining my own biases as well as institutionalized racism. I always look forward to new episodes!",5

Accessible,02/19/2018,Wholover0911,"This podcast is an amazing way for ALL people who are interested in learning about perspectives and social causes that they may not feel comfortable or informed enough to seek conversations themselves. As a POC this podcast is SO validating. And hearing from my friends (esp. friends who are white) they feel engaged in the conversation without ""taking up space"". THANK YOU!",5
Fantastic,02/20/2018,Borntoobeking,They’re commentary is amazing and each episode discusses another important topic. I have learned so much about topics that concern people of backgrounds other than my own and how our struggles in this country do not exist in a vacuum.,5

Vital and Heart-full,01/09/2018,Phobean,"Sometimes I find it hard to listen to Codeswitch because it’s real journalism, real peoples lives, real struggle. I let my queue fill up with fresh episodes until I have the heart (until I feel brave enough) to dive in, and I’m glad when I do. Codeswitch is the media I wish I had access to growing up, instead of the polarized general tv news media and angry, liberal radio. I’m grateful to have access to it now. Sometimes, when I’m not even listening to it I hear, in my head, the hosts signing off: “peace, be easy.”",5
Hope through the continued diminishing of humanity,01/09/2018,Brad Silk,"I love the way this show has incorporates news items and the social impact of these new motions. If more people saw how the bills and laws that are being passed actually effect our daily lives we might actually see progress. The stories are brief but in-depth and I love hearing the hosts personal take, though they still allow space for other opinions.",5
Care about America? Then listen to this podcast,01/10/2018,Journalismjunky,"Always insightful, always thoughtful and usually pretty funny when needed. I appreciate the perspective the code switch team brings to a range of issues - whether I agree fully or not. Never ever boring.",5

I want this podcast every day,01/13/2018,Amihatt,"Code Switch has it all: charismatic hosts, thoughtful research, superb editing and storytelling, and surprising angles on important topics. Code Switch is my model when I write podcasts and articles. The weed boom article, the article about Mary Hamilton, the school of kings series - each episode raises the bar for other podcasts. NPR, I think you should invest whatever resources are necessary in this team so they can produce episodes every day.",5
Code Switch is a MUST Hear,01/13/2018,NickCHPA,"As an older, white American, one who believed he was aware of America’s racism problem, Code Switch has shown me I had no idea of what it really means to be black. Some episodes are funny, some not so much, but all are entertainingly informative. I especially recommend the episode “This Racism Is Killing Me Inside.” We all, but especially white Americans, need to become aware of, awakened to the reality of the continuing racism in our culture and in our country, and the devastating and corrosive effect it has had and is still having on black Americans and on us all as Americans. Please listen.",5
Thank you.,01/13/2018,jpmurton,Thank you. Thank you for your dedication. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for the times you’ve allowed us to see you losing your patience. Thank you for connecting me to the humanity I’ve been blind to.,5

Advocacy versus Bias,01/15/2018,FrankPrewitt,"I am a big fan. With both information sourcing and news selection criteria getting more difficult every day, this program reliably eases my anxiety by providing thorough reporting. Conveniently (for their proverbial reader), they seem to naturally be predisposed to considering their stories responsibly. Make no mistake, they are giving voice those who have no voice, but not without scrutinizing it as well.",5
Incredible reporting,01/15/2018,hella808,"Tackles important and at times heartbreaking topics with depth, sincerity, and candor. I always learn something new and occassionally tear up.",5

Like the best class ever,01/17/2018,joanilla,"I dream of my (sociology) students growing up to sit around talking over coffee and their own brilliance, moving all kinds of discussions forward, upward, and down deep deep deep just like this.

I don't know how I would have made it through the last year without the Code Switch podcast.",5
Stay Woke,01/17/2018,krfire221242,5/5 podcast. Only critique is that once a week isn’t enough! It would be great if you could do a mailbag/Twitter show once a week where you just answer questions from listeners and give takes on current events.,5

Gives me life,12/20/2017,MixedGirlMane,"As a person of Mixed-Race, I’m constantly feeling like I need to overly represent for all of my ethnic backgrounds. I feel alone In this quite often. So discovering Code Switch, I feel less alone. Hearing stories of other People of Color or Mixed-Race hears gives me a place in the world.

My favorite podcast,12/28/2017,Jenna albany ny,I like to this of myself as a woke white girl- but then i realized i didnt have many black and brown voices in my new and media feeds. I started listening to Code Swicth and fell in love AND learned a lot in the process. I love that the episodes are all different lengths and often they are shorter than other podcasts in my feed so i can alway fit them in. I sometimes am brought to tears by the content and many other times laugh out loud. All the journalists are excellent. I cant wait for every episode. Thank you Code Switch.,5
Worth listening to every episode,12/28/2017,KevDiggy,There’s a wealth of insight about the many and diverse facets of all cultures and people that are explored on this show. Lots of truth being revealed here!,5

It's good to be uncomfortable,01/06/2018,maryrburns,"I've just finished listening to every episode of Code Switch, and it consistently confronts me- a white, upper-middle class, Republican-raised woman- with questions that make me uncomfortable. I have twinty-nine years worth of historical and cultural catching up to do and Code Switch not only introduces those ideas to me, but is unapologetic about the fact that they are not necessarily for or about me, and the culture I grew up in cannot be considered the norm. That's difficult for me, and I value Code Switch deeply for it. You have a listener for life.",5
Great podcast,10/26/2017,Shonita160,Love this pod cast.,5

Brilliant take on race in America,10/30/2017,Recalcitrare,"This is my #1 go-to for people who aren't living the code switch experience trying to understand race in America.

Magnificent coverage of the Ron Brown school,11/01/2017,Ardrigh,"Code switch is the finest and most provoking podcast I listen to each week. This latest series challenged so many of my biases about public education.

"Great topics, conversation",11/01/2017,Ottusch,I love the topics they cover and share this podcast often with my students.,5
Phenomenal,11/02/2017,T-McD,"I just got done listening to the 3-part series on the D.C. school, Ron Brown College Prep High School. The series impacted me so much, I actually shed some tears. The quality of the reporting and all-sides immersion of the day-to-day work and challenges in the school really shed light on how difficult it is to bring about change within institutions, especially schools—even when certain policies directly affect generations of black and brown students. The best of NPR is this podcast. If you haven’t subscribed, you should.",5

SO GOOD,11/07/2017,amirjoon,"I absolutely love this podcast. Literally every time an episode ends I think “already??” I want it to be twice as long! I feel like I’m hanging out with warm, funny, incisive, friends. The main hosts gene and shirin are incredibly engaging and intelligent. Their reporting manages to be focused and far-reaching. The explanatory comma episode (I know, sounds boring) has stuck with me and I think about it regularly. It was mind blowing.

Mo newz,09/21/2017,Mikky D,"This podcast breaks down the serious and not so serious but even the not so serious can have serious implications.

Thanks for that ""Code Switch"".",5
A podcast worth listening to,09/21/2017,cam328,The hosts of this podcast do a great job of having conversations about things going on in the world.

Be Easy,10/03/2017,knightau,"This podcast has been one of the best experiences for me as a black man in my adult life. It equips me with some really great tools and knowledge for how to go talk to my friends and family about issues important to me, and keeps me informed about issues others don’t report on. Being able to have a direct line into issues concerning people of color with a top notch team is an amazing experience and I thank this team for that. They inspire me to live my best life, if anyone from the team ever reads this I’ve got mad love for you and one day I’m gonna be on the podcast so don’t go canceling it anytime soon. Be easy.",5

Grateful for This Show,08/27/2017,Curtis216,"I'm extremely grateful for this show. The staff are passionate and dedicated. Each episode is interesting. Sometimes I'm shocked or flabbergasted with the views shared in their reporting, but then I'm relieved because that's why I choose to listen to this podcast. I'm white, and while there are people of color in my life, I never get a chance to be a fly on the wall and listen to their concerns as they share them with each other. More often than not, I find myself on the same page or at least sympathetic to the views expressed on Code Switch, but when it is uncomfortable or disruptive it's a healthy, educational discomfort. Thanks to EVERYBODY on the team. Be easy!",5
The one podcast I never miss,08/27/2017,Sadie7000,Consistently interesting.,5
So thoughtful and so necessary right now,08/28/2017,BSLM62,Shereen and Gene have taught me so much; they have opened my eyes to so much my white privilege has blinded me to. They are courageous and provocative and smart. Bravo for podcasts always worth listening to!,5

One of the faves,09/01/2017,omgojv,"Thanks for the last episode ""I'm not a racist , I'm Argentine!"" Much needed. This type of racism in the Latin community doesn't get enough light.",5
I hear of issues and perspectives I otherwise wouldn't hear,09/01/2017,BRCampbell,"Code Switch provides information that I wouldn't hear of from mainsteam sources.

Love,09/05/2017,Aimeeeereeee,I love how listening to this podcast when I'm in traffic or walking my dog around the neighborhood.,5
Code Switch makes me a better person,09/07/2017,EnerSanctum,"I'm a white dad to two adopted black sons, both of whom are now young adults. Honestly, I started listening to this just to get a better perspective on BLM, but it quickly showed me how much I had to learn and how deeply entrenched I was in (and ignorant about) my own white male privilege. Now, a couple of years later, it is by far one of my all-time favorite podcasts. I listen to some podcasts (S-town, Ted Radio Hour, On Being, Harry Potter and the Sacred Text) for entertainment, but Code Switch actually helps me be a better dad, better American, better world citizen, and a better human. Yes, sometimes it's challenging and uncomfortable, and sometimes I even sob uncontrollably when I'm confronted with something especially hard. Plus, the hosts are just phenomenal. How often do you get such genuine transparency and authenticity as the hosts grapple with their own issues too? This show and its contributors are a treasure.",5
Best Podcast ever!!,09/09/2017,ValdezMarissa2018,I love this podcast. It's has interesting stories that I don't hear anywhere else! The history of hispanics in the census changed my life. I recommend this podcast to everyone.,5
Consistently thought provoking,09/09/2017,LA Hapa,"The subjects that this podcast tackles are not easy ones, and -- as some of the comments below reveal -- may trigger defensive reactions from those who have difficulty seeing the experience of 'the other' as legitimate. I don't always agree with everything that is said in this podcast, nor should I expect to. My experience as a must-ethnic person of Asian and European background is undoubtedly different than that of some of the guests or hosts, but it's important to hear the diversity of perspective that's out there. Thank you for challenging me at times, affirming me at others.",5
My favorite podcast ever,09/10/2017,Apo1026,"I've been listening to this podcast since episode 1, and it always challenges me to learn more about each topic. Depending on the episode, it might make you laugh or cry, but you'll definitely leave each episode thinking about the world we live in.",5
One of my top podcasts,09/13/2017,deemcnguyen,I always look to see if there are new episodes of this podcast. What I have learned from Gene and Shirin is invaluable! Please keep doing what you do. Thank you for all your hard work.,5
Interesting conversations!,09/14/2017,Mfrancic,"The show is engaging and contains interesting and necessary conversations. I feel like it could use more input from white people, as they are often a subject but not well represented. That being said, overall it is a great podcast. I am a white male. I am interested to hear the input and learn how I can better myself and my interactions with others.",4
worth a listen,09/15/2017,Taraflara,"I have only been listening sporadically, but I find the format and content of the podcast to be current, engaging, and challenging. The hosts are informed and dig into challenging issues with skill. I really like and hope it continues. It is hard to always ""get it right"" for all listeners when approaching racial issues, but this show is giving it a go, and I commend them for that. Keep it going!",5
Informative,09/17/2017,Sunny Shae,Good stuff!,5
Insightful and thought provoking,09/17/2017,Boulderholder111,Always leave knowing more about our country and our world and the challenges we face. Code Switch has most certainly broadened the scope of my knowledge and pushed me to think more critically about how to solve the issues of our time.,5

Insightful,08/18/2017,Wagnearo,"I've enjoyed this podcast for a while now, and the commentary on Charlottesville was some of the best I've heard.

I continue to be grateful for the way this team grapples with a multitude of different issues. Keep it up!",5
Very Diverse,08/19/2017,Abmetelus,I am new to Code Switch and I'm already addicted. I love the diversity on the podcast!,4
A Must Listen for All Americans.,08/19/2017,BlancoBen,"Code Switch is incredibly important for our society today. As someone who learned the term code switch when I was a white teacher in an all black school in DC, I am personally very passionate about the importance of being able to authentically and safely exist in various spaces in our society. (No, it was not TFA. I was not ""assigned"" to this school. This was a job I chose and loved.) For me, it meant valuing and respecting my new community in the same way I would any new culture in which I chose to live. Learning the language, the customs, the history, and the value system. For my job as a teacher, to get linguistically nerdy, that meant I taught my students that learning standard American English (SAE) was about adding a language to their fluency in black english vernacular (BEV) while also learning about and honoring the beauty and rich history and importance of BEV. I wanted them to learn the skill of code switching without internalizing the linguistic and cultural oppression society tries to put on them.",5
Thanks!,08/20/2017,juniperhall,Thank you for sharing interesting topics and perspectives. This is a great show!,5

Code Switch is having the hard conversations,08/25/2017,dinobren,"The word ""conversation"" gets thrown around a lot for how to educate more of us and constructively progress on multiculturalism. Code Switch is actually having these conversations, and it has inspired me to have a lot of real conversations with my family and friends as well. I'm white and I enjoy at times feeling challenged, even angry at what I hear. It means they're doing something right. I acknowledge that educating white people is not always their mission - it's on me to supplement their reporting and interviews with other research and life experience.",5
Brilliant,08/26/2017,Kfbaofbdpgnd,"And honest, fresh way to learn about cultures other than my own, and to hear answers to questions I might never have asked. This podcast is especially helpful for white people like me, to have a place to listen and learn and become better equipped for tough conversations.",5
High-quality journalism,07/08/2017,MoonySBCB,"The Code Switch team is doing important work with this podcast, and doing it ~very~ well. This podcast is a multifaceted exploration of the way people experience race and culture in their lives, and the journalism and storytelling is consistently solid.",5

Deep dives - digestible episodes.,07/11/2017,Xooties,🏆💜,5
Demby must go.,07/12/2017,Gillianwithaj,"I was fine with this show up until Gene Demby made flippant comments about ""beige rage"". He's ignorant. Just as I can't speak to his experience as a black man, he shouldn't speak to the experience of light skinned or biracial people. Unsubscribed.",1
Enlightening,07/12/2017,Nikkijohnson0919,"I binge-listened this summer, and value the diversity of voices and perspectives on each episode. So valuable in our current political climate. Keep it up.",5

A MUST LISTEN,07/14/2017,Beethzart79,This is a fantastic podcast. It's really found it's footing and it's voice. I've been a loyal listener since the beginning and it continues to get better and better. Gene and Shareen keep it all together but the contributions from all of the hosts are eye opening and sometimes tear inducing. I love this podcast and can't wait for each episode.,5

(And be easy. ) ;)",5
Gives much to think about,08/10/2017,BeckyUtt,"This is one of my favorite podcasts, the one I share most often. The presentations don't presume to tell me what I think, they challenge me to think deeply to form my opinions. At times it is uncomfortable, at times it gels something I knew, at times it is funny. I like that they work to include all people and their perspectives, Latinex, black in all its forms, Asian, white, etc. Keep up the thoughtful way you are educating me.",3
Among best podcasts on race & identity,08/12/2017,Blueflo,"Anyone who wants to better understand race and identity should listen to this podcast. Eye-opening, sensitive, and smart.",5

Awesome educator resource!,08/12/2017,CalifaGringa,"As a Spanish teacher who builds curriculum and themes around social justice themes I have to give huge props to Gene and Marisol as two of the most valuable curators of topics that affect my students and my greater community, global and local. I i've been listening to your podcast since it came on the scene and I would encourage anyone in education to listen to all its episodes and inform their practice from the crucial conversations that take place here. Especially if you teach AP Spanish, US, or global history courses!",5
New ideas,06/06/2017,vanguard16,"I'm a white, straight, female listener. While I don't always agree with -- or even understand -- what's discussed on this show, I have listened to every single episode and shared several with friends and family. Being exposed to these viewpoints is so valuable, precious even, that I find this podcast necessary in the current political and artistic environment. Agreeing or not agreeing is really not the point: this is a podcast America needs.",5
Pushing good conversations!,06/10/2017,sarahh0101,"Having listened for a while now, I can honestly say that the podcast has been pushing my ideas about race and culture in today's society, in such a positive way! I appreciate the honesty and the candid conversations happening and glad I can share in them through this podcast. My only wish most times is that the episodes would be longer! Most times it feels we only scratch the surface of a great conversation and cut it off too early!",4
"Thanks, Code Switch!",06/13/2017,ambolm,"I love this podcast! So much of what I know (or think I know) about race comes from white people. This podcast has given me the opportunity to learn about issues affecting people of color, from people of color. My opinions have been challenged in so many ways since starting this podcast, and it's allowed me to view issues from a different perspective. I highly recommend it!",5
Quickly became a fan,06/14/2017,Weems,"Found this one when looking for interesting conversations about Get Out. Since then, I've gone through the back catalog and remain subscribed.

Thanks to this whole crew who makes such an engaging, thoughtful and vital contribution to the world.",5
This show keeps getting better and better.,06/15/2017,Motttt,Really coming into its own. A great episode to start with is Gene Demby's interview with Moonlight director Barry Jenkins.,5
multi-faceted,06/15/2017,L_inmotion,"I really love this podcast. It's interesting that because the first episode was about whiteness, a lot of the reviews have focused on that- especially the negative ones. I have found in subsequent episodes rich conversations about multiple aspects of race and how it intersects with other experiences. I have found reflections of my own multiracial experience that are hard to come by in the media. I have even enjoyed the discussions about pop culture, like television shows, which I sometimes get bored with.",5
Interesting and entertaining show,06/16/2017,Artistanal,Code switch chooses really interesting and engaging stories to dig into. The follow up on those stories has the team talking to informative and often entertaining people who are either experts on the topic or have first hand experience. The production of the show is great and overall I would recommend it strongly.,5
Thought Provoking Content,06/16/2017,Emerald H.,This podcast touches on significant concerns in today's society. Worth a listen.,5

Of course it's hard to listen to sometimes...,06/22/2017,Chef LizzyO,"Race is one of the most difficult conversations to have, but also necessary. Sorry white people (of which I am one), race is still an issue in the US and open discussion is essential.",5

"Challenging, Thoughtful Stories Told by Voices You Don't Always Hear",06/28/2017,FoxieJD,"After a year of listening to the Code Switch podcast, I find that the topics the team engages in are usually extremely thought-provoking, and challenge my own way of thinking, which I really value. I love the varied perspectives, and the way they promote critical thinking.",5
Issues I've never heard diss used elsewhere,06/28/2017,Skeshav,As a first generation Indian American this podcast has discussed issues I've never heard the media. Its been amazing to hear stories that relate to my culture and identity. You can tell the hosts and creators are trying their best. Sometimes they may make a mistake and in my book that's ok. At least they are trying their best and open to being told they messed up. (example: episode on tupac where they alienated some of their audience/ they tackled this head on) I've also enjoyed hearing the episodes that I don't relate to directly.,5
"Top-notch journalism, eye-opening social critique",06/30/2017,Kay ben-Avraham,"I can't get enough of Code Switch. As a white woman, I spent most of my life submerged in the myth of a post-racial America, and it's taken me far too long to awaken to the reality of so many of my fellow Americans. Resources like Code Switch have been absolutely invaluable in the journey of deeply listening, deeply seeing, and learning to mourn with those who mourn. I'm so grateful for their work and the high-quality material they produce. Thank you!!!",5

Helps me talk about race,07/06/2017,DianaNeptune,"I'm white. (And more than that but still, white.) In the past I found it hard to talk about race. And I sometimes found it uncomfortable to talk to folks who were not my own race - all these elephants in the room. This podcast has helped me talk about race and reflect on complicated identities including my own and the contexts we live in, historically and day to day. It's also really well structured and voiced. The hosts ask great questions, and offer super solid reflections let it end the way it started: Complicated.",5
For a balanced media diet,04/13/2017,llamapadeast,They are the best. I hope they keep digging into meaty and relevant discussions. This podcast regularly includes a dialogue that **needs** to happen. I often wish the discussion would keep going when each episode ends. I love it!,5
Enlightening,04/13/2017,Freebird klynn,"This is a terrific listen. I live in a vanilla world and am desperate for insights into life and experiences that I can't find in my day to day existence.

Yes!!! Great coverage ...,06/05/2017,Chicago renting,"I sent the ""DJ Blackface"" episode to every House-Head DJ in Chicago that I know. Fascinating. I could leave a review for every episode I've heard but this module of the app won't allow it. Great programming!!",5
Ignore 1 star comments,03/07/2017,Nietzsche-Preacher,"This was a very enlightening podcast. Most of the 1 star reviews are from people who listened to 1 podcast, saw the words ""white people"" and racial fragility made them give it one star without even listening. Very weird, as Code Switch routinely has White people delicately speak on their first hand account of whiteness and performances of it, but still other white identifying people erupt. Compare that to the 400 years media-based of racial essentialism and disparagement by members of the majority yet POC only remonstrate this much if someone says racial slurs, not just say the word ""Asian"", ""black"", etc. Also, I see a few POC giving it low stars because it's racialized. Sad. Robin DeAngelo is a genius because she crafted a theory of social defensiveness (""white fragility"") that is applicable to all raced and sexed categories. That is, some POC exhibit more fragility (usually white fragility) than white-identified people themselves. Listen to Code Switch so that you can deconstruct race and stop letting it govern your life. Racism exist. See? I said and didn't spontaneously combust.",5
Cult of Victimhood,03/09/2017,WhiskeyKnight,"So on the latest episode there was a panel discussion on ""allyship."" The women on the panel proceeded to disparage the motives of their white friends and allies for a solid half hour. One women even claimed that white people cannot even be allies to PoC, because doing so only reinforces their privilege. These kind of moral purity tests could not be more uncharitable and self defeating. I can't imagine going about my life with this level of suspicion and resentment towards my fellow human beings. The people on this panel may indeed be victims of societal oppression. But more than that, they're victims of their own cynicism.",1

Indispensible in America,02/17/2017,ow1n,"I started listening to this at the end of 2016 because it was obvious everyone needs to have more empathy for everyone else, and some need to work on this more than others.

I am so thankful for these conversations,02/20/2017,mp707,"This is the show I've been waiting for NPR to produce and now that it's here it is so much better than I thought it would be. NPR is often easy listening, and this is not. It's challenging, civil, and voicing perspectives that aren't readily heard. Constantly introspective, and with my own explanatory comma - This is because the editorial decisions appropriate for this show are not canonized. Euphemisms are outted. Keep up the hip hop interstitials - make me feel at home.",5
Absolutely Amazing,02/21/2017,Drickiss,"This podcast is amazing and leaves a lot to unpack. I look forward to Code Switch to get me through the work week. I admit that it's not for everyone and some people just won't get it. That's fine because for those of us that do, it's a breath of fresh air. Keep up the good work!",5
Sticking to the comfort zone- not good enough,02/21/2017,Petra46,"I was very hopeful about this podcast from the 1sode. Then...-It has become 'mainstream 'about race. The opportunity to open a real analytical, self-reflective conversation among races got lost pretty quickly. A white host voice is missing, for a round table on equality. ""whitness is elastic"" (from ep 1) so true, but elasticity is not among whites only. Where is your reflection on that? - (on Black Oscar ep) FACT is:Van Jones went on and interviewed AA that voted for 45. (so did latinos, and other ethnicities) were is the self reflection on race on these realities? - Again. You went mainstream. The issues are way more complex. You are sticking to your comfort zone.3 stars for effort. - P.W.",3
Informative and accessible!,02/21/2017,Lyss Brick,Awesomethey do this to allow people to listen to discussions of race that they might not partake in in their every day lives in the comfort of their earbuds. I have learned a lot from it and think the hosts are great.,4

A Diaspora of Color Experiences,02/23/2017,jayarsmi,"I've come to truly see and understand the affect of white America on all people of color in this country through this podcast... it covers a spectrum of controversies and discrepancies that minorities face.

Code/Switch,12/06/2016,Pogonap,"This podcast grabbed my attention the first time I listened. I wanted to know more about what people of color where experiencing and thinking about and the first Code/SWitch podcast I heard was ""whiteness'. That was not the first motivator in my journey to support racial justice and equality, since I had previously read, with shock and disgust, that extreme racial injustice, for the most part, has merely changed its form since post civil war times. But this podcast adds a new level of understanding that increased my desire to learn more, participate and support those in the midst of this continuing and worsening crisis.",5
Informative / Amazing,12/08/2016,Nahyah,My favorite podcast so far. Intellectually stimulating and truly American.,5

Worthy listen,12/10/2016,ojymak,"While not every episode is (I think) long enough or dives deep enough into the issues at hand - some are more like footnotes than full chapters - it's nevertheless been great to hear commentary from a specifically minority perspective. As a white woman, I don't necessarily even need them to go deep on everything - just hearing their non-white perspectives on bigger and smaller things alike - expands my own. I've learned so much just from listening to them.",4
Important Conversations from an Important Space,12/15/2016,Edprst,"Perhaps because it's an NPR podcast, I've seen feedback that criticizes Code Switch for making white people feel ""left out."" As a white person, I'm very frustrated when white people expect themselves to be centered in every conversation. I have never felt left out as a Code Switch listener. When topics come up that make me feel confused or uncomfortable, it encourages me to interrogate *why* I'm uncomfortable or research so I'm no longer confused. I hope that the hosts, producers, and people who make funding decisions for the show recognize that provoking this sort of discomfort is a strength of the show, not a weakness.",5
So good,12/15/2016,Yawn_Bored,I love Shereen and Gene. They're so smart and this podcast is necessary. I love it when Gene calls people from NPR his play cousin. So good.,5
One-way code switch,12/15/2016,WhoCares1980,"I may have a misconception or two regarding the premise of the podcast. After a number of episodes I'm coming to feel that the show is comprised of people of color speaking about various aspects of living in a white-media dominated society. The conversation is between individuals who identify as people of color, but I would reiterate one listener email which said that it doesn't feel like everyone is invited into the conversation. The hosts have a tendency to reflect on their experiences against a backdrop of white interpretation but leave a lot on the table in regards to interpretations of various ethnic groups by other groups. Or how about addressing the sliding scale of cultural awareness? I'd like for there to be white participant in the conversation as well as maybe a person openly acknowledging that they don't fit the mold of their skin color. There just seems to be a missed opportunity to touch on cultural nuances. I want to hear about life in between the lines. Not just from one side about he other.",2
Bigots preaching to a white guilt ridden audience,12/19/2016,Ilsickness,"I want to start this off by saying I have listened to every episode they have put out and will continue to listen to every episode they put out to gain a better understanding of the regressive left. According to NPR audience demographics listed on their site, they have an overwhelming listener base of wealth whites living in affluent cities and suburbs. This particular program is clearly market to their main demographic as well as affluent POCs living in mostly white areas. Their views on the reality most white people experience can easily be disproven if you have ever ventured an hours drive out of your major city. They have no problem trying to tell you about your own life experiences but would be all to quick to call you a racist if you did the same. They have this notion that white people are uncomfortable talking about race. I have to agree, but this is because it is not a conversation. We are expected to listen to how horrible we are and when we bring up a time a crime was committed against us that we felt was due to the color of our skin, we get labeled a racist. This podcast only focuses on how white wrong other races and never tackles bigotry between ethnic groups other than whites. Unfortunately, because they have been so successful in gaining listeners within their target market their bigotry will never be exposed.",1
Excellent podcasts,12/20/2016,Devlinjade,"Love this show! Makes me think about issues in a way that I normally wouldn't think to, given my background and experience. We need to have more conversation like this as a nation.",5
More consistency please,12/21/2016,Weihtoquiteweih,"Episodes aren't consistent. They go on break a lot/ play ""encore""podcasts and their episodes are so short. So I don't know what they are trying to bring with each episode. What's the point.",1
Thumbs Up,12/26/2016,Aviself,"I subscribed to Code Switch a while ago and listen to the episodes periodically but have accumulated a bit of a backlog. On a long drive a couple days ago, I went through the episodes back to back. As far as I'm concerned, there is a ton of value/perspective in these episodes...listening to the topics and contributors back to back and juxtaposed to each other was even better. There are so many themes that emerge over and over again...one of which was simply the importance of thinking about people as whole, complex beings not the oversimplified versions that are portrayed so often. Like other reviewers, I was surprised and not surprised to see some of the other reviews here and I agree that many of the reviews capture why the existence of the podcast is so important.",5

Code switch = what tea party is to moderate republicans,12/29/2016,173764ehsbd,"These guys (note: they will cry bloody murder to me referring to them all as ""guys"") are analogous to the tea party's relationship to moderate republicans. Code switch is a podcast that is actually a support group for overly sensitive hacks who preach about respect and freedom and repressing oppression by repressing freedom and respect for anyone who says or thinks differently. For example, they complain as nauseum about the Other, yet claim to be Other-ized. This podcast is in desperate need of a reality check.",1

The Real Talk episode on Obama and race is a treasure, in part because it looks back at the reactionary and counterproductive forces set loose during the past eight years. It reflects the kind of daring and thoughtful talk on race and culture that has made Code Switch a part of any well rounded podcast diet.",5
Thankful,01/05/2017,Flammifera,"I'm so thankful for this podcast - in a recent episode, they explored the 'explanatory comma' explaining who or what non-White people or culture are - but I'm grateful all the podcasters & writers on Code Switch share their thoughts and reactions. Leaving a review here to thank them for this work!",5
We need a POST-Election Analysis,11/10/2016,nu4jm6,"Listening to LATIN@ USA - I knew Code Switch was a podcast for me. And from the beginning, your podcast has been insightful, powerful, spot-on!",5
So Biased,11/10/2016,Rshaner,This podcast is so biased and it's rare if the hosts ever consider anything other than their own viewpoint. I would hope as journalists they would report more factually on subjects and not so subjectively.,1
"Thoughtful, impassioned, and absolutely necessary",11/11/2016,Lshop365,"Gene and Shereen and their guests are doing the good lord's work, speaking to NPR's white audiences (that's redundant) about racism, patriarchy, and other destructive institutions that our white privilege has allowed us to willfully ignore or not consider in full and truthful depth. I am particularly grateful for your most recent post election show. Thank you for helping us to process this horror we are now in and begin to make sense of how we move forward.",5
Insight from voices worth listening to,11/11/2016,Beezy36,"This podcast has helped me process through an incredibly tumultuous year in society. From Orlando, to the countless senseless deaths of black people, to the recent results of this years presidential election- I've turned to this podcast in hopes of hearing some dialogue that is honest, realistic, insightful, and hopeful. I have not been let down. Thanks codeswitch. Keep doing what you're doing.",5
Keeps challenging me,11/12/2016,PrincetoJoni,"Though it's not always an easy listen, it's one I'm glad I subscribe to as it clears cobwebs and flips things on their head. Your guests in particular make this show a worthy investment of my time.",5
Not helpful.,11/12/2016,rrosczyk,"A very frustrating show. I thought it was going to be an honest discussion of race.

It feels more like Cultural Studies 101 at a liberal arts college. This helps no one.",2
Dear fellow white people: Worth your time,11/13/2016,K. Stubbs,"I'm white, and I believe that it's my responsibility to try and educate myself about institutionalized racism and the privilege that I have as a white person. I've found CodeSwitch to be an invaluable source of information and perspective about what it's like to be a person of color in the US. The team is having really difficult and insightful conversations that I otherwise would probably never hear. I've learned so much from this show, and I hope that more people -- especially other white people -- will give it a try.",5
Ruby,11/14/2016,Gus Ruby,Excellent,5
Thank you,11/14/2016,Rachel S in Seattle,"Heartfelt thanks from a white woman struggling to feel some kind of hope after the election. I am grateful to be learning from journalists of color about how to be in the world as it is now. The feeling that my government is hostile to my values and even my self is new to me, but I know it’s not new to communities of color and other minority groups, and this podcast is helping me learn from these communities' expertise.",5
Awesome!!!,11/15/2016,Csmochilera,"This is a great podcast. Especially if you're white and you'd like to be more educated and informed about race... because as a white person, you really don't have to know this stuff. So you have to try! Just read through some of the negative comments on here... almost all of them are from white people who really should listen to this because they honestly have no idea what they're talking about... they didn't learn anything because they obviously weren't listening (or were so offended by being called white or privileged (which they are) that they just didn't pay attention). If you're white and you care about ""helping the world"", listen to this podcast and others like it (listed below).",5
Love it,11/16/2016,Orrangecolorado,This podcast is a great job of showing how race influences our society. It's educational and gives me lots to think about while being non-aggressive. Definitely check it out!,5
The show should be called white people are racist.,11/17/2016,Abdullah Moh,That is the subtext of every episode. The hosts demonize the white population of this country and blame white America for every problem facing minorities.,1
Absolutely love this podcast,11/20/2016,Piepie81,"This podcast is amazing! Finally I've found just the right about of news and personal stories to keep me interested. Both of the commentators are intelligent, caring and witty! I'd recommend this podcast to all of my friends.",5
Waste of time,11/21/2016,daminant,"I listened to the episode about young asians wanted their parents to understand BLM. It's a complete waste of time. The whole show was playing pity. Look, the girls are crying and so emotional, they must be right, right? The cast were constantly saying, ""Yeah, my parents are like that"" as if it was something to be ashamed of.",1
Informative and friendly,11/22/2016,Kareally,It's nice to hear numerous perspectives on difficult topics. I think they've done a great job to not pigeon hole people based on their race or alienate listeners.,5
Meh,11/23/2016,👁❤️👁,"It would be great to have more racial diversity/inclusion in regards to the topics covered. It's not bad, but it's not great. Example: DAPL has been a topic of discussion for 8+ months and they haven't covered it. Just like the rest of the mainstream media, native issues go unnoticed, pushed beyond the general public's concern. I was hoping for better than the status quo, but alas...",2
Love this podcast,11/23/2016,Colleenie514,"Thought-provoking, timely and more relevant now more than ever. Really thoughtful and honest discussions that help me to think of different perspectives. Appreciate the length of each episode and the multitude of backgrounds and perspectives that are represented.",5
my favorite go-to place for real discussion of race,11/24/2016,tippering,"I have become a dedicated listener to Code Switch over the past few months, and love the perspectives and questions that Gene and Shereen and the rest of the crew serve up here. They bring complexity and different viewpoints into the mix, centering the perspectives of people of color. Desperately needed, especially in these trying times. Keep it coming!",5
An excellent look at race in culture,11/25/2016,American Caesar,"I appreciate hearing a multitude of voices regarding the issues which we deal with, and NPR delivers a wonderful plurality outside of my own experience. Code Switch is indispensable, especially today.",5
Podcast treats minorities as though we're one group,11/26/2016,Pat114155,This podcast treats minorities as a monolith that should have one understanding of the world. It does not allow and is openly hostile to us having different opinions.,1
Tough discussions all should hear,10/09/2016,Exposing eclectic NJ music,"Whether you're white (especially if you're white), or a person of color, this is a poscast that features much-needed conversation about the experience of being non-white. I am Latino, and trans, but read as white and male. I can tell you the many ways that I gain 'accidental' privilege, but this podcast has further opened my eyes to my own subtle and ingrained racism and the way I stereotype people. I will continue to listen to these challenging, necessary discussions! Authentic, heartfelt, occasionally passionate, but on-point and enlightened repartee! Kudos.",5
Important,10/09/2016,adanator210,"In a world where minorities of all kinds are continually put down by those in power, bad reviews are unsurprising. People are uncomfortable discussing power, oppression, etc, and this pocast does not shy away from these topics.",5
Diverse voices at the table,10/10/2016,NCsurf,I really like this show. I'm a middle aged white chick. I like that this a forum to talk about one of the most pressing issues in American society. It's plain talk about personal experiences and perspectives of race that affect all aspects of life. It addresses the interpersonal and systemic issues. The contributors address the intersectionality and nuances of a host of current events and historical topics. I recommend it!,5
Pretty solid conversations abotu Race,10/11/2016,Lankysam,"I'm a white guy who's trying to get better at understanding race in the US, so I checked this out. I've listened to about a dozen of the episodes, and there's some really good thought provoking stuff in here. Sometimes its uncomfortable but probably that's good for me. I think there's a real value to being a fly on the wall of people talking openly about their experiences with race (since I always make the conversations I'm in whiter, just by being there).",4
Fun discussion,10/13/2016,cminor,"Fun and informative on American culture and lives, thoughts and experiences",5
"Informative podcast about the ""other side"" of America.",10/15/2016,l00Caliban00l,"Frank conversations about race, gender, etc.",5
Does not promote equal exchange or respect among all Americans,10/15/2016,as1876,"The moment this podcast lost it for me was when Gene recounted a conversation with a white uber driver. He says the driver tried to engage him about one of the unarmed black man police killings, explaining views that differed from Gene's views as well as some misunderstanding. Gene says at this point that he basically checked out of the conversation and gave the woman the cold shoulder because she wasn't worth his time. This stunned me, here you are a -representative of the extremely socially progressive NPR, from a radio show about engaging in talks about race..... really?? Wouldn't the better option have been to engage with the woman and explain your views and try to help her understand how you see the event as a black American? Maybe direct her to your OWN podcast so she can gain a new perspective?! Huge misstep that I can't get over, this show has potential to bring positive and equal dialogue between all Americans but it's own staff aren't even promoting it",1
Recommend for all listeners,10/16/2016,Starbucks Pete,"A favorite, for sure. Gone back and listened to all the old ones after I subscribed!
I'm a middle-class, white guy who is learning a lot and will hopefully be a better member of society to all people around me for the experiences I hear on this show.",5
Incredible insights!,10/17/2016,Ayanamireib,"I've learned so much by listening to other perspectives, as told by people who have lived a very different experience than I have. It's opened my eyes in so many ways. It's accessible, yet nuanced in its take on race in our society in this day and age.",5
I love this show.,10/18/2016,TylerVale,"I don't get a chance to discuss race very often with my friends or family and this podcast has served as a wonderful opportunity to have a ""conversation"" about these important topics.",5
Uncomfortable? Good,10/26/2016,mrdadelus,"I've been lisentning for a few months now and I have to say this podcast has far exceeded my expectations and certainly challenged me.
Its uncomforatable to challenge preconceptions, especailly if they're well meant. No one wants to talk about race or diversity or change but the biggest let down of the generation that gave us a real shot at civil equality dropped the ball by pretending the conversation was over. Untill we get it right, untill we can spend every day taking for granted that our brothers and sisters are being treated with the same respect (or equal disrespect) as we are then we all have a lot of work to do.",5
Interesting and on point!,10/28/2016,karenqtx,Love this podcast. Much appreciated. Keep up the great work!!,5

What I needed,11/02/2016,cjx3illo,"Great interviewing and great racial visibility from a bunch of different perspectives. This is the first time I've gone out of my way to save episodes to re-listen to. It's also validating to feel represented in a podcast as a feminist Asian American that cares about racial issues. Media like this is SO important. Please keep going, can't wait for every new episode. My only wish is that it gets extended to 45-60min episodes.",5
Awesome but could be so much better,11/03/2016,Raven O.,"Easily one of my favorite podcasts. Sometimes I wish they had guests with less public speaking training, normal people as opposed to scholars.

A great show,11/06/2016,fanofharry,I so appreciate the variety and thoughtfulness of the discussions on this show!

One of the best,11/09/2016,batgirlsnack,Great podcast. Great hosts. Great topic. A must listen.,5
"Engaging, difficult conversation",08/31/2016,NQL5555,"This podcast does a great job of making me pause and think about how race touches life in so many different ways. The episode on Nate Parker really highlighted how difficult race and art and criminal justice can become intertwined - and it brought forward the hypocrisy that we as society seem to have towards famous people and rape culture. Great stuff, one of my new favorite podcasts.",5
Love it.,08/31/2016,Gej2108,"Such a great program! It is interesting, warm, difficult, and truly a treat to listen to.",5
"If I could give zero stars, I would!",09/03/2016,1980Polly1980,I'm so tired of hearing about racism. If anything it's made me more hard-lined and intolerable!! It appears that most of the issues in our society are poverty issues not racist issues.,1
Not as objective as it may seem,09/05/2016,Grantos,"It started out as a pretty good and interesting podcast with an objective take on race issues and infesting topics pertaining to race, but it slowly seems like they are aiming this towards minority audiences exclusively. I'm a twenty something white male who considers himself to be really open (I started listening to this from its inception), but this podcast makes me lose a little hope in the country ever having a truly objective look at race. Not sure it's possible. Have fun listening to people whine about their names being mispronounced! There's plenty of other great npr podcasts to check out.",1
The best thing since Michel Martin,09/05/2016,Carolsummit,This podcast should be required listening for white people. I felt the same about Tell Me More. Good writing. Good topics. Keep this on the air and get rid of the old stuffy programs.,5
Valuable listening,09/06/2016,Brtyu7775457,"Especially valuable if you are interested in thinking about issues for underrepresented groups. As a privlidged individual myself I find that their tone is always very upbeat - never offputting. At the same time, they dig into ways of thinking and viewpoints that I have not been exposed to. And it challenges my thinking - definitely worthwile to keep up with this evolving show",5
"Great usually, sometimes uneven",09/06/2016,hwpw,"Some episodes are absolutely searing and so well done--everyone in the whole country should listen to the episode about Philando Castile's driving record. Others are a little more slight and feel unfinished. Overall though, a worthwhile listen most weeks.",4
"great podcast, despite the rating",09/08/2016,anazards,"as a white person listening to this, I realize how much I have to learn from black people telling their side of the story, aka how it is to be black or any other minority in western cultures. No matter what bad reviews say, this is worth listening as long as youre humble enough to take others' POVs",5
"Remarkable, Thoughtful, Necessay",09/08/2016,Crissydv,"Conversations about race are never easy. But this podcast's way of doing it is incredible. It's thought-provoking, yet safe (for lack of a better term). Those who don't have to ""code-switch"" in their day to day life would enjoy it if they put aside their immediate notions. It isn't really about race, it's about the intersection of it in our daily lives. I love this show, and the critics who are so quick to judge it based on their fragile feelings of criticism are not seeing the point. Keep up the great work Code Switch team!",5
Classic whining,09/09/2016,Me1372816363,"Typical blame game, ""it's not my fault"" BS.",1
"Smart, topical, important",09/13/2016,rahrahlouis,CodeSwitch answers so many questions that I have and sometimes that I don't realize I should have. CodeSwitch should be required listening for anyone trying to wrap their mind around how race intersects with so many avenues of life in the modern Western world.

Great podcast,09/17/2016,Kim W Il,this is a very good podcast. I think it's worth depot of all races listening to.,5
Getting after it!,09/21/2016,Asproutinsnow,Code switch is helping me bridge the cultural divide that has become a chasm in recent years. Creative content and poignant subjects are well produced and leave a lasting impression. I'm engaged from start to finish. Code switch is killin it.,5
Educational & Relatable,09/21/2016,bsbs19,"This podcast is excellent and covers a broad range of issues, all of which are equally valuable and interesting. This podcast is done in such a way that it feels both educational and relatable, meaning it brings to light issues that are necessary for white America to listen to and develop a greater understanding of, while, it seems, also being something that people of color can listen to and feel as though their opinions, thoughts and voices are being represented. As a white woman married to a man of color (specifically a black man), and who volunteers with a social justice organization where I am inside California prisons, serving predominantly populations of color, it is always valuable for me to hear direct, honest perspectives and experiences from people of color. Thank you for this weekly slice of greatness.",5
Definite listen,09/25/2016,Dcan12345,Level headed and informative. Great show.,5
Surpising,09/28/2016,Sean Dana,"I checked out Code switch after and listening to it's advertisement on another NPR Podcast. Being white and living in a small town in the south, which is 90% white, I hadn't heard other opinions or takes on many of the issues discussed. Code Switch gives these opinions in a thoughtful and intelligent manner. It's has given me a new perspective on the world and food for thought.",5
These are the conversations worth having,09/30/2016,Stonygut,"Code Switch is great. I hear the conversations that I'm having with friends, as well as the conversations I'm not having. The diversity of voices and perspectives featured here is unlike anything else. This has quickly become my favorite podcast. As a mixed-race, first generation son of Caribbean immigrants, this is one of the only, if not the only place that I consistently hear at least a piece of myself and my perspective represented.",5
Relevant and real content,10/05/2016,filicana,I love this podcast. Ya’ll are real folks talking about things that really matter and taking nuanced approached. The episode about why Tupac is still relevant today was awesome. I try to listen as much as I can. Keep up the great work!,5
Hit and miss for this PoC,10/07/2016,LauraLooking4App,"Some episodes enlighten (""Trigger warning"" and ""Good immigrant"") and are a pleasure to listen to. However, for the ones that are not good (and I listen through the whole thing waiting for it to get better and usually end up disappointed), I feel that the commonality they have is that it sounds like the people are just venting. Some examples of this is the episode on people not saying names correctly and the ""Guide to handling casual racism."" I'm a mujer of color that also experiences racism and other isms, so hearing other people talk about the microaggressions they suffer is boring.",3
Great conversations,08/10/2016,Beckys review,Keep up the good work and encouraging tough discussions!,5
A mostly balanced approach to tough issues,08/10/2016,A Conservative Democrat,"I understand the most recent show about names. As a black woman with the simple name Mary I often get a ""is that all?"" Or they try to ghettofy my name or act as if I didn't enunciate with a ""Do you mean Nary, Maury, Marie?"" But I understand most times people can make assumptions by your name so...I get the other side of the spectrum.",3
So important and so good,08/10/2016,countchapula,"I love this podcast. Informative, sensitive, historical, thoughtful, surprising, moving - it actually has it all. Such an important show, I'm glad we have it.",5
Love!!,08/10/2016,Fbirknbnn,Every single episode is so on point!,5
Schmeh,08/12/2016,Plasticanimalz,"Liked the idea of this podcast but execution not so good. The 1st ep. was surprisingly mediocre for an NPR show but I listened to a few to give it a chance and they only seemed to get worse. I felt like I was watching a cable-access show of NPR interns talking about their opinions, with very little research or facts offered. The hosts are not particularly informative, entertaining or interesting and it sounds like a bunch of 23 yr olds who think they're informed but are just spouting off subjective opinions, and know very little about life, but are narcissistic enough to think it's compelling. Do us a favor and put them back at research desks and let them learn and 'earn' their way up rather then handing some young-uns a podcast so NPR seems more diverse. I learn more by listening to 2 Dope Queens AND I get a laugh. There has to be more compelling AND experienced diverse voices out there. Give them a shot.",2
Hones conversations about race,08/12/2016,Rouxdevie,"Let me start by saying if you are white, you may have a tough time listening to these interviews unless you're open to hearing some harsh truths. Full disclosure: I'm ""yellow."" For me it's easy to blend into society without thinking about my race until I am confronted by a slip of a racist comment. These stories are welcome because they remind me of my identity, especially since it's so difficult to talk about these topics when you have non-communicative, first generation parents. I even had to wipe away some tears during the letter read by the Vietnamese girl in an attempt to explain her support for the black lives matter movement to her first generation father. Thank you for all of the work and thought you put into each episode. One suggestion is to do a show on how people handle random racist comments, particularly when they come from friends or coworkers.",5
Fresh and Engaging,08/13/2016,DDlodi,Interesting insights from smart people talking about issues we need to talk and think more about.,5
Thanks Code Switch,08/14/2016,Merrik2,Very thankful for this podcast. I consider it a public service providing invaluable perspective and discussion on a topic that very few tackle meaningfully in the media.,5
Thank you Code Switch,08/15/2016,Maddie29354,Really happy to see these topics being addressed in a high-traffic format,5

A much-needed podcast,08/22/2016,Tigerbunny342,"I love this podcast. As a white person from a southern state I do not feel berated or abused or ashamed by the presenters and their guests, as some reviewers do. I recognize that I benefit from white privilege but do not feel like anyone is trying to make me feel guilty about it. Instead I feel empathy and try to right wrongs, even if I am not responsible for them.",5
Really Challenging and honest,08/23/2016,Wookie299,"It's a very good show and it's challenging to listen to because it comes from a perspective that is very different from mine. Yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable at times, but I feel like anything smart will make you uncomfortable from time to time because it's pushing you.",5
I beg your pardon,08/24/2016,drewarney,I listened to the first full episode. Privileged Americans podcasting their jealousy of privilege white Americans. We ALL live in the most prosperous's culture in the history of the world. Instead of encouraging people to embrace the opportunity you encourage people to continue hate. You are creating more of what you're acting like you are trying to improve. I beg you to open your mind to this possibility.,1

Insightful Podcast!,07/25/2016,KoryJaxn,"This is my favorite podcast. I listen to each and every episode - and I'm so happy when I see that I have a new one waiting! The topics are on point. Yes, they may push boundaries of race, history and context in America but the subjects are explored in such a way that makes you think and feel something. Seek understanding or do your own research but it's always interesting and thought provoking. Never dumbed down or boring! This is food for thought. Please keep the episodes coming!",5
Highly informative!,07/25/2016,1strike,Great analysis of the Philando Castile tragedy without focusing on systemic acrimony often associated with mainstream media.,5
Fantastic,07/30/2016,Darren Byler,Wonderful to get well researched and argued reporting on contemporary race and politics. This sort of storytelling and analytical arguement is essential to shifting the discourse of what counts as normal in the American life.,5

"Excellent reporting, interviews",08/01/2016,CoraBoBora,"Their reporting on Philando Castile's 46 traffic stops was thorough and thoughtful. They discuss not only the facts of this particular case but also the larger trends in policing, race, and community that led to it. Highly recommend.",5

Interesting and Necessary,08/02/2016,SlySlySyl,Thought-provoking and incisive explorations of race and identity in real time. I appreciate the insights of the hosts and the perspectives of the guests. Totally necessary in our current reality. Keep it up!,5
A nice discussion on real issues.,08/03/2016,Yosoyleche,The hosts are very professional and the segments always have great guests. It's short so it never drags and the podcasts leave me feeling better about whatever racial issue they're covering.,5
Covers Difficult Topics in Approachable Way,08/03/2016,Ashlitas F.,Code Switch takes on the nuanced aspects of conversations on race that other media doesn't. What is objectivity in reporting? How do people talk with their family members about current social movements? This podcast has challenged me to think critically about some of the underlying issues that inform the way we discuss race in the US.,5
"Came out great, burnt out fast",08/03/2016,Camgue,"The first couple episodes tried very well to delve into complicated subjects. Has since went down hill. We get it vote democrat, trumps a racist, and there are inequalities. Why not discuss the issues and how people have solved these issues on a smaller level perhaps. But seriously this show went to crap.",2
Great podcast,08/03/2016,Jifflefly,This is quickly becoming one of my favoite podcasts. They have the guts to talk about things so many of us tip toe around.,5
"What does ""Objectivity"" mean to Journalists of Color",08/03/2016,CCRedmond,"Every Code Switch episode I listen to gives me greater insight as to what it means to be a person of color in this country. This episode was such an eye opening lesson for me as it reminded me once again to always keep an open and questioning mind while listening to anything from the media. To question who their sponsors are, who they think their listeners are and what are their reasons for the report. Thank you for your excellent thought provoking podcast.",5
"Good, but room for improvement",08/05/2016,LoveisintheStars,"I love the concept behind this series. We should all seek out different perspectives and experiences. The hosts are likable and don't pretend to have all the answers. However, that's what's often most frustrating: the episode concludes with the hosts admitting they don't have answers to our current problems and while that's fair, it somewhat mitigates the point of the podcast. If every hot button issue concludes with ""I don't know"" it doesn't inspire more confidence to tune in each week.",4
Don't Believe the Hate,08/05/2016,Chuggface,"I appreciate the space that writers of color have made for themselves in this podcast. It's honest, spoken from their personal experiences and reactions to current news and even reflects the small micro aggressions in daily life. I find it validating to hear these well accomplished people tackling some of the same issues with race, gender and sexuality that I face. I can't wait to hear more.",5
Listen for yourself,08/06/2016,Angelstar260,"But not what I thought it would be. There was 1 really great episode after Dallas. But the other episodes were seemingly young journalist taking about their personal lives and interviewing their friends. Meh, I I subscribed.",3
So excited to find this,08/07/2016,ChristinATX,I have fallen out of love with blogs so I was super glad to find there was a Code Switch podcast. Ideas and perspectives that keep me on my toes. I'm always excited to see a new episode arrive.,5
Excellent!,08/07/2016,RadioAddct,NPR is the best.,5
Excellent show,08/07/2016,Alecmt,This show provides a much needed focused discussion about race in the US and equally well serves as a starting point for conversations with loved ones. I'd like to see some more engagement with the conceptual underpinnings of each topic.,5
a voice for the voiceless,08/07/2016,makeda42,"I am so pleased to find that this was split off as a podcast. At a time when voices of color are being silenced in national media, it is so gratifying to hear these voices speak out about the experiences and frustrations that ""we"" experience. Since the voices are multiple, I don't always recognize my experience, but that is the insight that I crave. NPR is centered in the northeast and now California. I just wish they had more geographically diverse voices on this show. Keep pushing!",4
Thought-provoking & insightful,08/09/2016,Bcay237,I love the exploration of pertinent issues and guest appearances by experts. Definitely needed at this crazy time.,5
Great exploration of race and identity in America,07/11/2016,Baguette_Du_Sorcier,"I was shocked to glance in the reviews of Code Switch and see so many negative reviews--but after reading them, I think they stand as a perfect testimony for why a podcast like this is so needed.",5
Excellent Start,07/12/2016,crsmp,"Great idea...keep it going it'll get better.

Gene practice speaking slower...",3
Cool,07/12/2016,Who? Who?,Cool,5
It's actually good,07/13/2016,Awww shucky ducky!,"I'm a huge gene demby fan from his podcast post bougie. So when this rolled out I thought it was gonna be good. I really enjoyed the discussion on Ali, it's been absolutely great since then.",5
Well worth the listen,07/14/2016,Ken_Yeezy,Subscribe!!,5
Great podcast,07/14/2016,Smw13!!,Eye opening podcast. I've loved the blog for a long time. The podcast goes even deeper.,5
Excellent.,07/14/2016,fendstat,"""Black and Blue"" presents the unique insights of black police officers into black-police interactions.
On the lighter side, ""Made For You And Me"" explores the relationships between various people of color and the great outdoors.",5
2 stars because it's NPR & well produced,07/14/2016,Ehodges05,"otherwise, the marketing for this podcast is totally misleading..It's basically like NPR made a podcast to show white people what it's like to have every race represented except your own, delivering content & opinions from their personal views/perspective on what you think, believe or do. experts on white people & the bias and mishaps they cause.. This isn't a bad thing, I just think it's better to not mislead in the description & own it. people will listen no matter what because it's an NPR podcast, but i just wanted to comment because while I don't disagree with the views represented, I think they had a platform to engage a broader audience & establish a more ""balanced"", realistic dialogue focused on making progress & missed that opportunity..",2
Something to Expand your Perspective,07/15/2016,HappyFutureGradStudent,"As a young white man who came from a very white household and had all white friends it was a shock when I first went to college and finally began to become close to people of lots of different races. By the end of school though my best friends were Indian and black, and my girlfriend was Hispanic. I learned so much in conversations with them that I never understood before. This podcast is another fantastic way to expand your perspective. It challenges me to think more about how I act and what I say and informs me more about aspects of race I never understood. Keep up the good work!",5
Thoroughly enjoyable,07/15/2016,Millie Lovers,I'm a huge fan of the show!!,5
Love it!,07/16/2016,Pod Blankie Cast,Was looking forward to a Code Switch podcast and it didn't disappoint!,5
Breath of fresh air,07/16/2016,Emmjayee,"This show is a breath of fresh air. Thank goodness NPR is putting out a show that challenges it's listeners to feel unsettled and to rethink their realities. Amazing to hear an all POC team, especially as a POC myself.",5
Insightful,07/16/2016,1nProgress,Refreshingly empathic journalism bringing thoughtful analysis with a dynamic and diversified team of young professionals. The Code Switch team approaches stories with a genuine curiosity of discovery and a collective fearlessness to deconstruct complex issues. Love it.,5
Awful!,07/16/2016,Whatisthisgarbage9999999977777,"This podcast is awful, racist garbage.",1
Love this podcast,07/17/2016,ggrove,I'm a white senior citizen and am learning sooo much! It's really opening my eyes to the inequality of our society.,5
"Great show, much needed, needs work",07/18/2016,Chin Kim,"I wish this were a regular NPR show instead of just a podcast. My guess is that older, white listeners would defund NPR if it were on the air.",3
The best!,07/20/2016,Annietheknitter,"Finally! I am so happy that this podcast finally exists! It is absolutely amazing, I can't recommend it enough.",5
Great addition to political podcast landscape,07/20/2016,Cmtlang,I love the point of view of this podcast. I have started looking forward to it every week. The episodes following the Philando Castile and Alton Sterling murders were especially healing and cathartic.,5
Interesting take on America,07/20/2016,DarthEvil7289,I wondered what kind of podcasts this would present and was pleasantly and surprisingly engaged by the show. I watched the one on OJ and the more recent podcast on Philando Castile which was a simple presentation of his history with police stops. Measured and thoughtful. sometimes challenging. Keep them coming.,5
Telling reviews on here,07/20/2016,peinkypanna,"It's great that this podcast started out with the whiteness episode because it came out strong with what we will see to come from this podcast. I enjoyed that episode and every episode afterwards. Constructive criticism: the direction of the show is confusing as each episode has a different staging from the prior. It needs to keep a somewhat consistent pattern, like popular NPR shows like Invisibilia, TAL, Planet Money, Hidden Brain, etc. Other then that, they talk about the issues that I want to know about, especially recent news which is informative but feeds the emotional need. Please don't let these haters on the reviews sway your opinion of this great podcast. They are just white people (maybe even just mentally) that haven't realized that not everyone is white - says a white millennial woman.",4
Interesting & varied,07/03/2016,KatieM&$6,I enjoy listening to podcasts where I am not the target audience. Podcasts that speak to life experiences I don't know and never will in a first person sense. It helps me better understand the world around me and gives important context to US events. This podcast is part of my effort to know more and I hope they continue to navigate what is a task.,5
White people might not like it but they should listen anyway.,07/03/2016,DougSarver,"As a white person, I have found this podcast interesting because it helps me to see how other parts of the country might be percieving me. I am a white male and I am better able to see my privledge with help from shows like this. I do wish the show also had a white voice to help give their perspecctive as well, though. Without that, the show feels less like an educational program and more like a protesting one. Let's find solutions together.",4
White People Are MAD,07/04/2016,Boomshala,And obviously missing the point.,5
Not Quite Their Yet,07/04/2016,Nita.B.Brown,"For me, this podcast is still trying to find its footing. Focus on those untold stories such as the one on Margaret Cho's breakout show for Asian Americans. As a black women, the similarity in experiences of seeing people like yourself, you forget that it exists for other races as well. Those or the type of stories that will help to unite listeners. OJ Made in America was a unique story as well, because of my age I didn't realize that he had manufactured his image in that manner. Thanks and I look forward to your continued growth and success.",3
Fly on the Wall,07/05/2016,Maestra Wilson,"I looked for this podcast a year before it came out and am delighted that it is finally here! I am a White non-Latino person who is eager to hear about the different perspectives that are part of our diverse American community. I have listened to all the episodes so far and don't feel that they are ""making White people feel bad"" (like another review said). I feel like I am a fly on a wall where really smart people of color are talking about current events and pop culture and mixing those current events with historical events and their personal experience. Keep up the good work!",5
Breath of Fresh Air,07/06/2016,leeleeg,"This podcast really is awesome and interesting and a window to perspectives you wouldn't normally get. I listen to a lot of shows but Code Switch along with NPR Politics are now my favorites. I don't understand the negative reviews. I'm white and would not get these kinds of insights without this show. Thanks, Code Switch.",5
Awesome podcast,07/07/2016,Good form,My fave,5
This is Fantastic Podcast,07/07/2016,jeffmasters1,"I love this podcast. They discuss race in interesting, insightful ways that I don't hear anywhere else.",5
White tears below,07/07/2016,Collectorofwhitetears,"So many white tears in the reviews below, I would need more than one swimming pool to fill all their tears with.",5
"Calm down, fellow white people...",07/07/2016,Philnick93,"...they aren't trying to attack you. I think this podcast is excellent because they deliver a thorough analysis of what it means to be white, leading to some interesting points. Please don't be so offended and just listen. Race needs to be discussed in order to tackle racism.",5
Excellent,07/08/2016,AppleIsACult,"These are exactly the kinds of conversations we need to be having. The 'whiteness' episode was particularly interesting. The backlash in the reviews here is to be expected, but maybe more conversations like these will chip away at the hate.",4
Nerve Struck! Keep it Coming.,07/08/2016,Pearlkabra,"Whoa, this show is pretty benign as far as what could be said about race in America.",5
Buzzwords galore,07/08/2016,Justin_ham,"I had a bad feeling about this show, but I decided to give it an open-minded try. After listening to two full episodes, I can say that it has confirmed all my suspicions. Diatribe & racial divisiveness all under the guise of progressivism -- big words but little substance. These types of issues/ideas ARE important to discuss, but NPR has entirely missed the mark here.",1
Just what I've been seeking,07/09/2016,Talimander,"I'm so glad CodeSwitch team finally have their own podcast. Particularly as a white person, I find the hosts and guests to be informative and balanced. Am I in agreement with everything said? No. Neither would I expect or want to be. I'm seeking something more--thoughtful insights, wit, new perspectives--and I'm finding that with these episodes.",4
Refreshing and Smart.,07/10/2016,jessica.d.oliveira,"I've become obsessed with this podcast, and can't stop talking about it with friends and coworkers. Thank you for the research you do, and the time you spend bringing up the concerns on the hearts and minds of people of color in radio. I look forward to future seasons and want you all to win!",5
Great Podcast,07/10/2016,LaurAlyBee,"I was so excited when I heard the buzz around this podcast on NPR. I was not disappointed. Great conversations! Interesting, informative, and unique.",5
Possible game changer,07/10/2016,l.Ellison,"It's taking a moment for this podcast to find its feet--understandably so, it only just began. A few episodes have had little to add to the conversation about race in the US, others have been interesting but still mostly regurgitating ideas that can be easily found elsewhere.",5
Just listen,07/10/2016,Reneegaudetdesigns,I am learning so much. Thank you all for your time and efforts to put forth this needed podcast.,5
"We are all colored, but does it matter?",07/11/2016,Young bob 37,"From what I know, every physical body has color regardless of race. Here are some questions I would like to ask the journalists of this podcast. Can you tell what are the different races of the human soul? And if we have souls and there is a creator as in God who created us, does God then identify us according to race? I say that if the creator sees me for who I am then why should I not see myself or others that way?",1
"Great show, doing important, difficult work.",07/11/2016,xtianrut,Code Switch is an intelligent and nuanced show about the often-difficult subject of race in America. The hosts and guests are consistently excellent. Great work all-around.,5
"Interesting, but...",06/26/2016,Dhregs,"It's a pretty good show, but some of the episodes, as well as little moments in each episode, just make me roll my eyes.",3
Whites don't like 🤔,06/26/2016,Topoftheworld1901,"Code switch coming to NPR is like 2015-16s baby- if that makes sense! The hosts are touching topics I think about, come across on the news perhaps, or deal with in my day to day.",5
So happy this conversation is happening,06/26/2016,Cguido28,"I am so happy that npr has something of their usual quality to add to the conversation about race. Amazing hosts, great blog transformed into a fabulous podcast. Ballsy and enlightening",5
Horribly racist,06/27/2016,JTaaa,"I'm sick of these ""discussions"" on race and ""whiteness"" that are one-sided. That's a lecture not a discussion. Don't tell me what I think-ask me what I think.",1
Racist,06/27/2016,Singram9988,"Very disappointed, this podcast is racist again whites people. A bunch of non white people talking about what it's like to be white. Saying non whites don't go to national parks, obviously you have never been to Yellowstone!!!",1
Meh,06/27/2016,Under20andlistening,"First I would like to start by saying the podcast has little content, and no storytelling. And while I enjoy their topic and feel they made some valid points they seem to focus solely on faults/differences of white people. Making it feel less of an attempt for racial equality, more like a rant or even dangerous propaganda.",2
What Public Radio Should Be,06/27/2016,bemob42,"Smart, well-produced conversations on important topics with great interviewees. I hope that some of the defensive one-star “we're post-racial, stop trying to make me feel guilty for being white” reviewers will stick with the show and see how much we can learn. Public radio should be educating the public for more informed civic engagement; this show is absolutely doing that. Thank you!",5
Poorly designed podcast,06/27/2016,Emi+nem,I tried really hard for awhile to listen to this podcast but I couldn't get into it,1
Awesome podcast,06/28/2016,Maddie r w,"People saying this is racist or giving it 1 star, you guys have a lot to unpack about racism obviously (as do we all). Maybe try to listen from the vantage that their points are valid, and see where that takes you. Smart and accessible. From, a podcast addict and white person.",5
Nonsense,06/29/2016,Landong,They know nothing of the real world. They fight racism by being racist (the non-white privilege).,1
Amazing,06/29/2016,Another person here,"I have been waiting for this for so long. White people who are sad and hurt, don't be. It's not designed to make you feel guilty. Race is just a reality for many of us. And we need space to think and discuss about it.",5
A lot of the reviews are why we need a podcast like this,06/29/2016,Laurita B.,The fact that so many people aren't comfortable listen to a podcast like this is exactly why you wanted to continue to do it. Thank you for bringing on multiple people to discuss their experiences in relation to personal history and current politics. I will continue to listen so that I stay open to other perspectives and experiences different from my own.,5
So necessary,06/29/2016,Jdmen,Thoughtfully considered topics and discussions. Really well done and important to our times.,5
"Thought provoking, hasn't quite found its voice.",06/29/2016,Teddyboyforever,"First of all, I like how many peoples button's this is pressing. That means they're on to something. Uncomfortable conversations are good. I don't know if they've quite hit they're stride, but it's early yet. And yes, people will get very wadded up over this stuff, big deal- keep going!",4
"Great start, don't mind the trolls.",06/30/2016,Cichor,"Actual listener here. I appreciate your approach with the first episode on whiteness. I first heard of the host on Another Round so I knew he would be great! Thank you for covering some Asian-American issues, I'd like more on the model minority myth. Especially since a lot of times AA like to keep their head down on issues of race and racism.",5
Interesting topics,07/01/2016,Lfreeman00,"Wow there is a lot of anger on here that is completely uncalled for. This podcast's discussion about whiteness was just that - a discussion. No white-people-bashing at all. But people's anger over this podcast is exactly what the hosts were talking about; It is hard to talk about the American white identity because people don't have the tools to do it. We as a country have never learned how. People either ignore it or get really defensive. Anyways, the podcast discusses interesting topics in a casual tone. I found that it sparked discussions in my own life...and, yes, it made me think about my own white identity...but I wasn't angry about it.",4
Rep sweats was on point,07/01/2016,Mel Nuni,"That episode was the type of topics I thought the podcast was going to be focused on, good one!",4
Reductive and tired examination,07/01/2016,Mechblue,The topic is interesting and the production quality is high but the content is weak. Simplistic views of large groups of people based on their skin color neither elucidates nor gives us a path forward to make the world a better place. If the call for social justice consists primarily of feeling guilty for being born with a certain color skin don't expect it to be answered by many.,2
Interesting cultural journalism,07/01/2016,westontt,"I see this more in the realm of an intelligent discussion about culture - and pop cultuer - with a focus on the ways we categorize ourselves and others. Still early to tell how this will endure. BTW, I'm a white guy and never felt targeted or unfairly represented in any of the episodes.",3
Doesn't finish well,07/02/2016,Sleevesmcfly,"At the time of this review, there are 6 episodes out and I've listened to them all. This podcast does s great job of raising questions, but falls short of answering them. However, I do think that this show is a step in the right direction for representing people of color on public radio.",4
White people are the worst.,06/19/2016,eandonova,"Are you white? Do you hate yourself? Are you perpetually apologizing for being born white? You should be. If you're not always apologizing for the great privilege of being born white, you're a horrible person. It is impossible to care about racism while white without feeling ashamed of the great shame of being born white. Never mind that you have absolutely no control over being born white. Apologize, you're an oppressor. Do NOT, whatever you do, say that a person of color talking about your whiteness might be wrong. You cannot talk about people of color, but you better be open to listening to their life stories. Ugh. Get out of here. Such dishonest discourse.",1
"Yes, please",06/19/2016,Pnwfan,"I have been waiting for this for years! A dedicated space for the amazing Code Switch team to explore race, culture, politics and the intersectionality of modern American life. Yes, whiteness should be discussed explicitly. Yes, as a young white lady, I needed to hear the different impact that Muhammad Ali had in communities of color. And yes, raising up queer voices of color is essential for understanding and healing after Orlando.",5
Promising but awkward,06/20/2016,Roachie D.,"Premise & reporters are good, but show doesn't seem to have its footing yet.

Also, a podcast about disenfranchised voices being sponsored by Air BnB seems a bit tone-deaf and super awkward to listen to, IMHO.",4
Awful waste of time.,06/20/2016,Khanal13,Awful show. They are trying to find racism or connection where there is not. They need to do their research right and come with an unbiased point of view,1
Amazing,06/21/2016,A friend like them,"I love how it discuses the
Origin of stereotypes because of the discussion of POC in The outdoors I was introduced to my all time favorite video the black hiker.",5
More crying,06/21/2016,Cloud father,From people who want everybody to share the exact same ideology,1
Oh god this podcast,06/21/2016,Youcandobetterbuzzfeed223,"Content from NPR has been getting worse for a few years now but this sets a new low. Code Switch examines race in America with with such a microscope that the podcast could be passed off as a parody of NPR. Was told it would make me laugh, and it would make me think critically about race. Didn't expect it go have me laugh at their critical thinking on race.",1
Good beginner conversations,06/22/2016,u3drive,"Race is uncomfortable to talk about. These discussions are respectful, approachable and give appropriate steps for action. The panel is diverse and so are the topics. It's not in depth on many topics, which I'm sure annoys people with more advanced understanding. But I would point people here for a good starting point for racial conversations. The basics are hard to get right and I think this podcast does an excellent job.",5
Loved it!,06/22/2016,Cedarhillmom,Great shows! Don't know what the others are talking about. But anyway. Awesome show from an African American married (18 years and counting) and mom of 4. Keep on...Keeping on...Awesome!,5
Very engaging,06/22/2016,Donquay,"Academic, yet relatable. I enjoy the frankness which the hosts dissects and investigates beliefs and ideas often taken for granted as fact",5
This is an important conversation...,06/23/2016,AMCinDMV,"and we need to listen. 30's white female here - with all of the nasty reviews on here from Caucasian people, I feel as though that information is relevant. Guess what - there is a lot of pervasive racism in this country that white people never even see. That doesn't mean it isn't real or isn't having an impact on people's lives - it means it's way past time to pay attention. I really enjoy this show - I'm learning a great deal in an approachable, conversational style. Keep it coming, Code Switch.",4
A Must Listen!,06/23/2016,Hannah_is_a_palindrome,"I never write reviews, but after reading through a bunch of negative ones felt compelled to urge everyone to listen to this podcast yourself before making a decision. As an academic, I think this podcast is extraordinarily well done: open-minded, constructive, thorough, and respectful. As a human being, I think this podcast adds an essential element to the contemporary conversation surrounding racial, ethnic, sexual, gendered, and religious equality and mutual understanding. The discourse of whiteness is a fascinating and complex one, and this podcast is a stimulating means of exhorting us to question our underlying assumptions and unconscious biases.",5
Reverse Racism is real.,06/23/2016,screenbetween,Don't be shamed because of the color of your skin.,1
Wow,06/23/2016,Obamination,I can sum the first episode up in one word... Garbage. Don't waste your time,1
buh-bye,06/23/2016,cb_abq,More whiney NPR victim culture here.,1
Love the perspective,06/23/2016,Junoescareme,"As a white woman, I really enjoy this podcast. It is really interesting for me to hear issues explored that sometimes I have never considered. Even when it is an issue I am aware of, I feel like I'm getting a view of the issue from the inside. I always enjoy learning about other people's experiences and perspectives, and I appreciate how that is done by Code Switch.",5
Should be removed from NPR,06/24/2016,5 Star Reporter,Title says it all.,1
Code Switch has Saved NPR from Itself,06/24/2016,Lilysea,"The earnest white liberalness of NPR getting you down? Codeswitch has saved the day. Smart, refreshingly honest, real talk about race and culture in US America. Thank you so much, Code Switch team. You are awesome in all the ways.",5
Good show!,06/24/2016,MikeRT10,"A nice weekly update on race in America while we wait for the return of Our National Conversation About Conversations About Race! I find the podcast informative as it draws my attention to things in the news and pop culture that I might have otherwise ignored or missed the nuances of. Well produced and engaging as I've come to expect from NPR,",5
Must listen!,06/25/2016,perspicaciousfox,"Thoughtful, interesting and sagacious dialogue on race in mainstream that has come at an optimal time. If you're white and want to peel back the layers of white priviledge, this is an excellent show for that. Insightful perspective by a smooth host. I just finished one episode and will eagerly devour more!",5
Thank you!,06/13/2016,sphe96,Thank you for creating a space for a different voice! Your podcasts are challenging ang thought provoking.,5
love code switch.,06/13/2016,kimbrlymay,"code switch is one of my favorite wings of npr. as a white teacher who has spent 15 years teaching at a super diverse school, I feel like they address issues I see every day that I never even knew existed growing up in upper class suburbia. I feel like a lot of issues they deal with are very real and it's great to see them not being ignored.",5
Imperfect but essential,06/13/2016,Mose__,"Anyone who dares to talk about race, identity politics, social issues, and the like had better be ready to hear a lot of criticisms, coherent and otherwise. For example, anyone laying claim to a fraction of a definition of blackness will catch flak from others for whom the experience of blackness (or whiteness/non-blackness) differs. Codeswitch dares to talk about these issues. No one's ever going to ""get it right"" because the words that comprise much of the subject refer to wildly different experiences among the listeners.",5
Happy to listen to it,06/14/2016,elshaman,"I am glad to hear this conversation going on. It is in our discomfort that we advance a discussion that has been LONG overdue. Race, racism, whiteness, Latinos, language, merit and privilege are things that as ethnic minorities and majorities we do not come to grips with in any meaningful way. I will say that I hope that they can refine their messages a little better but it's an important start and we should all be able to acknowledge that we are more ready to fall into our stereotypes and assumptions instead of constructive and difficult debates.",5
Interesting,06/14/2016,Funny & Addicting,I don't know why other reviews are being so harsh. I'm white and enjoy hearing from people of color about things I may not have otherwise thought about. It's a well produced podcast from NPR. I've really liked the 2 episodes I've heard so far. Great job!,5
Pretty good so far!,06/15/2016,Blirwin,It may be unfair to compare it to a show like Embedded or Invisibilia - wonder how the budget of this show compares to other shows NPR has rolled out lately. I really hope this show gets plenty of attention from NPR and continues to improve.,3
Great Courageous Conversations,06/15/2016,NetflixUser827364,"The first podcast I've heard that addresses the topics of their podcasts with a critical lens, taking white privilege into account. A great podcast to listen to if you want to challenge yourself and broaden your tool box.",5
AMAZING,06/15/2016,Girl on a budget,I'm white and I love this podcast. Be open minded and accept that talking about race can be uncomfortable but that's what this podcast is about. It takes a lot of discomfort and courage to look deep into your life and the system you live in to see the balance of power and privilege. Give it a chance.,5
Push through your discomfort,06/16/2016,Team Izzo,"I'm surprised, though I shouldn't be, at the negative reviews. I think this Podcast is wonderful in that it talks about race unapologetically and about many different groups. Yes, I know most people don't want to talk about race. We were taught not to. But we NEED to which makes this podcast very timely and important. Don't be behind the curve by avoiding talk about race or worse- demonizing it.",5
Not worth the time,06/16/2016,Reverend Prof,"Whenever NPR debuts a new podcast, I at least listen to the first few episodes. With so many quality shows out there, there just isn't enough time in my day for this one. Some of the hosts speak so quickly it is hard to follow. The topics come across as opinionated rants rather than well-researched point of views. I also find it quite disappointing to hear race addressed with such clunky stereotypes in a podcast that is supposedly an intellectual conversation. For me it is borderline comical that the phrase ""persons of color"" is en vogue in public discourse as if ""white"" somehow presupposes some absence of any color. I also think it is lame that the term ""brown"" is being used in this podcast for all non-black minorities. It would never have dawned on me to label Koreans as ""brown"" and to think that minorities don't like the outdoors until this podcast put those ideas in my mind. I will be unsubscribing from this one.",1
Excellent,06/16/2016,TokenBlackGril,I've been looking foreward to this podcast since it was first annouced and I haven't be dissapointed. Thoughtful coverage of timely issues from a diverse persepective. I always look forward to the next episode.,5
thanks,06/16/2016,tuttlebuttle,for the show,5
Good podcast,06/16/2016,SooBooBooSoo,"I learn a lot from this podcast and enjoy listening to it. The first podcast about whiteness was thought-provoking and pushed me beyond my current understanding of the topic. I'm partway through the podcast about the Orlando shooting. The attack is tragic along so many dimensions. In the media to which I am exposed, the fact that most of the victims were Latino has been mentioned but almost as if in passing. This has been one more level of pain on top of so many others. I appreciate you highlighting this aspect of the tragedy and helping me understand more about it. Thank you.",5
Interesting,06/16/2016,Marked Twain,"Actually a pretty interesting listen - it took them forever to actually start up the podcasts. Sadly lots of negative reviewers for a podcast about non-whites talking about race…not surprised to see that when white identity is starting to be a conscious thing as the minority share of the country increases and pushes whiteness, eventually, into one of many types of people rather than the absolute clear majority. Keep going on and improving! I doubt most of the negative reviewers really listened to this all that much for an honest review.",5
Whites need not apply,06/17/2016,Eric the Stoic,"Yet another NPR outlet for shallow liberal ideas. The underlying theme is ""if you are white, you just don't get it"".
I like the concept of the show, but was disappointed with the lack of intellectual rigor. The content is something you'd find at Oberlin or Sarah Lawrence.",1
"Great potential, lacking execution.",06/17/2016,brobinsonx,This podcast has the ingredients necessary to produce a home run. Unfortunately it is hosted by unsophisticated millennials who either lack appropriate life experience or are being filtered by a politically correct NPR corporation. I will soon unsubscribe if they do not dig into more juicy content.,1
Important but without focus,06/18/2016,krs617,"I have mixed feelings towards this show. I think the topics are important but I haven't found the insights particularly engaging or original. Granted, I'm in an an academic community, so these concepts are pretty well-trod. On the other hand, if this show is trying to communicate to people other than people ""like me"" (e.g., progressive NPR-ites), it seems that they are failing based on the reviews on this page. There is a great chasm in this country between two PC mainstreams: the race-aware, race-sensitive and the ostensible ""color blind"" majority. This show does nothing to bridge that chasm, but only to highlight it. I think other shows have dealth with this subject matter in a way that provokes less instinctually defensive reactions, which is maybe the key to attracting and keeping listeners?",3
Great show,06/18/2016,Bearfkr,Great show!,5
One of my favorite new podcasts,06/18/2016,Tifa6513,"I am really surprised by the negative reviews. This is insightful, provocative, important stuff. I think they are doing a great job and I am hungry for more episodes.",5
"Well, it was a good try...",06/19/2016,Ed Hominem,"I get what these people are trying to do, and I understand that they have the best intentions, but it seems like they are mired down in acceptable language and popular (mostly) leftist ideas.",2
Was a fan until Ep 2,06/09/2016,aspen856,"Was an interesting idea for a podcast... Until episode 2. I feel many of their tangents and inputs are quite out of the scope of what the main theme could be focused on. ""You can't play soccer so you are racist against Latinos"" but that would also mean no cricket, no football, no frisbee, no GAA, etc...?",2
Don't bother...,06/09/2016,DannyP1224568,"The presenters are manic and need to slow down. Their voices gave me anxiety. The substance is not there yet. Unless the show changes drastically, I won't be listening.",1
Race is a hard topic!,06/10/2016,Mattatakiss,"I'm a white male and I was pretty excited to listen to this podcast to learn about my race and others and how it impacts society and the culture behind it.

Growing Pains . . . ?,06/10/2016,jspeyton,"I really wanted to be able to say that the NPR-haters, political wingnuts, and white folks who can't stand a story that doesn't end with them being god's gift to the planet are all wrong about this podcast and are just looking for something to dislike.

Boring and racist.,06/10/2016,KJimmy179,Racist and boring. Doesn't deserve to continue being a podcast.,1
Surprise! White people hate when they're not the center of the conversation,06/10/2016,YoYemiO,"NPR is seen is the bastion of progression, and it's no surprise there are people angry that there's a conversation that attempts to be more inclusive. I love code switch; I love the conversations. I'm learning and listening and enjoying this podcast. There 1 star reviews are a constant reminder of how unnervingly common and acceptable being closed minded is. I've yet to hear anything ""racist"" or prejudiced (which is actually the term to use) in this podcast.",5
Check it out yourself,06/10/2016,Muzic80,CodeSwitch proves itself right with the vitriol in these reviews. It's mostly white people griping about a dissection of white people—proving that you're uncomfortable having these conversations and proving that CodeSwitch and open discussions about race matter and should be had. Actually listen to the podcast before you just read the description and succumb to your immediate and most narrow-minded instincts.,5
Too shallow!!,06/10/2016,amishaofficialx,"I was so hopeful about this podcast, but after listening to it I am disappointed... There is no depth, just simple conversations that we've all had/heard before.",1

Talking about talking about whiteness?,06/12/2016,Krogals1,"Hey, I'm only one episode deep, but first ep was frustrating! I feel like they were talking about talking about whiteness rather than actually talking about whiteness. The message was pretty convoluted. Hoping future eps are more focused!",3
Whoa,06/13/2016,0hEugene,"I'm a white woman, and I do not agree with the reviews that are no doubt above and below mine. Leaving a negative review because this is not the perspective you want to hear is so 'white privilege' that it's almost comical. I am in no way pained to hear a conversation about race that excludes me from it. It's about time we all took a breath and really listened to each other.",5
Love the show,06/13/2016,Camila9696,This is a podcast that needed to be created. I love the combination of people working on this production and bringing light to many issues that people tend to ignore. I would love to hear an episode on hair how that plays into race and stereotypes. Thank you so much for this podcast! I highly recommend it to any listener. These are issues that need to be discussed.,5
✊🏾Refreshing & Hosts of Podcast are great.,06/05/2016,Sweet Hibiscus,Enjoyed the first episode. Looking forward to the next episode.,5
Great start,06/05/2016,secoles,"I have only listened to the first episode so far, and I thought it was well thought out and made some great points. The transition to the ads was a bit awkward, but I am sure as they do more that will get better.",4
Not Even Close,06/06/2016,Jaber C,"A poor attempt to instill guilt in white people. Race and ethnicity is a fascinating subject (even for white people), but they fail to mention anything remotely interesting about it. Nothing but the standard hate yourself, white privileged, guilt ridden drivel.",1
Really good stuff,06/06/2016,Holly41wood,"Just listened to the first episode and it exceeded my expectations. Those two professors you ad on the first ep ruled. Keep it up with the really interesting stuff, guys! I want to hear all about and from Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, John McWhorter, and all the other writers you mentioned, too. I want to hear about navigating the world as a black woman vs. a white woman. I want to hear about President Obama's code switching modes of speech. This has really great potential.",5
LOVE IT!!!,06/06/2016,ERAY Comstock,"So glad you all are having this conversation. And that is the way I listened to the podcast, as a conversation. There are no simple answers but there is so much to talk about and discover about ourselves no matter what our race. Please ignore the unhelpful negative comments and keep going.",5
Oh hey lookit that,06/06/2016,izi_sbk,NPR's new show where journalists of color talk about race is divisive and split between 1 and 5 star reviews! WHO WOULDA THOUGHT!,5
Let's talk about talking about race,06/06/2016,Thecreamofsumyoungguy,"I was open to this and came into the first episode willing to learn (disclosure: I'm a white male). They touched very few issues of whiteness and when they did only discussed them briefly. The entire episode was them talking about TALKING ABOUT whiteness and how difficult it can be to those who are white. Okay I'm ready, can you please talk about it now rather than dance around the subject for 35 mins? My only take away from the first episode was that white people have a hard time talking about whiteness; but apparently, so do these hosts.",2
Everyone who panned this...,06/07/2016,Hellawont,"Was not ready for the conversation. These reviews look like trashy YouTube comments. As a ""woke"" white man and former diaspora studies student, this is a good crash course into understanding whiteness through a lens that isn't mine. All this negativity is from people who still don't understand this concept, so please consider listening before you decide. If you can't handle ""the invisible knapsack,"" then you all won't handle what's to come.",5
You must want to care,06/07/2016,CKR114114224,"This podcast is aimed toward those interested in thinking critically about race and/in America.

Necessary,06/07/2016,morganfitzp,"1 Star = Defensive.

This show is garbage,06/07/2016,i'm not telling you my name,"Unoriginal, pandering nonsense that's all merely speculation. What has the world come to when this crap can be considered good radio?",1
Whiteness? Ok sure.,06/07/2016,ElizaGrass,"So, listening to two people of color tell you what it's like to be white, is exactly as un-entertaining as it sounds. As someone who is half Japanese but is ""lucky enough"" to be considered white by the general population, this show so far is ridiculous. The article they continue to reference, ""Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack"" is not current enough to use as a reference in a research paper today, yet it is a cornerstone in this podcast. The authors of this show must think that all white people have yachts and summer homes in wine country, because all of the white privilege indicators seem to line up with the lives of politicians' sons. Do yourself a favor and just Google ""stuff white people like"", it's funnier and less nauseating.",1
Cliche,06/07/2016,Dwight Kurt Shrute 1,"Not surprising that college professors would talk about whiteness. Why is their no discussion of why ""white"" is the only box you can click at schools, colleges or the federal government. Instead of your ethnic background like German American. You like the divide to be continued. You are not unbiased when you teach. Why not teach a class on how to value all our backgrounds and work together instead of continually hammering the same drums and dividing us further.",1

Comments Exemplify Topic of Podcast,06/08/2016,sss320sss320,"I thought this podcast was really interesting and touched on a topic that really needs to be discussed but usually is not. They took a tricky subject and were able to explore it in an honest way. As a white person this podcast made me uncomfortable at times, but thats a GOOD thing. I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people who can't embrace that uncomfortableness. This dilemma is exactly what this podcast touches on and it's so important to explore. It's really interesting how the topic of this podcast is exemplified so well in the reviews section.",5
Awful,06/08/2016,Ark-and-spark,I couldn't even finish the first episode. You can do much better than this. This is a very lame attempt to make people feel bad about being white. You should be ashamed NPR.,1
Racist generalizations,06/08/2016,Average White American,If a panel of white people wanted to talk about what it meant to be black in America would that be tolerated.,1
Boring and biased,06/08/2016,Troat,Overall a waste of time.,1
Awesome,06/09/2016,kzhang88,"So far I love it. I'm so glad NPR is tackling these issues that many of us have experienced our whole lives in a smart, approachable way. I only wish this podcast existed while I was growing up.",5
Made For You and Me,06/09/2016,Friar Francis,"I just listened to the “Made for You and Me” episode. It was amazing! I am a brown person who loves the outdoors and I can relate so much to the experiences of the people described on the show. I was so glad that this episode presented our country’s history of exclusionary laws in a clear manner and tied them to usage of outdoor spaces by people of color. Jim Crow laws, housing restrictions and the numerous other exclusionary practices that endured well into the 20th century are areas that deserve journalistic exploration. It is my sincere hope that topics like this will be better understood in the future. Airing quality shows like this that tie current topics with their historical context can only accelerate understanding. I, for one, was inspired by this episode.",5

Timely,06/03/2016,Dekooning,Very much enjoying the podcast so far especially since About Race is on hiatus.,5
Wow,06/03/2016,Mehvash,"That wow is on multiple levels. First wow for all the way harsh reviews. The first episode wasn't by any means perfect, but I liked that they chose an uncomfortable subject and spoke to a variety of individuals. Race is never easy to talk about, but I liked the approach they took to open the door to future conversations. You can't talk about everything in one podcast so I would expect that future episodes would tackle some of the things others thought were missing. I really enjoyed listening to this and it made me really think about privilege I experienced based on my own ethnicity and race identity. I look forward to the next conversation and am excited to see how this show evolves.",3
Terrible.,06/03/2016,Yo mama's cooking school,What a terrible podcast. In really hoped it would be good but it's just academic gibberish. Can we for once have a genuine conversation a of an important topic? Disappointed. Delete,1
Good Start,06/03/2016,Bizzle9,"I liked the first episode -- I'm looking forward to hearing the crew come up with more thought provoking takes on race (perhaps beyond the academic, critical studies approach). And one thing -- I can tell Gene Demby is a really smart guy, but he talks waaaaayy too fast. I found myself missing things he was saying at times. Maybe slow down a little? That's all ;)",4
Could have been so much better,06/04/2016,Stevenhyde,I think this show can be very valuable for society but thus far it fails to reach its potential. Could have done so much more.,2
I'm already distrusting and giving the side-eye,06/04/2016,L'Erin A.,Any show about race that starts by centering whiteness is not worth my time or energy. It seems more about educating white people than being a place for POC to really address the issues at hand.,2
Not as Benign as they thing,06/04/2016,Kevin2728,Fail to recognize their own prejudices,1
First episode,06/04/2016,Mozlvr,"The first episode is a largely a group of non- whites, telling white people what it means to be white. Frankly, I'm sick of non-whites telling me what my life experience is. I can refute many of the ""experiences"" they say whites have/don't have. If I were to address my personal experiences and those of family and friends in regard to being white, this post would be too long to read. As goes with race and the double standards skewed against whites, I am constantly reminded I cannot know their struggles because I am not their race. However, I'd like to point out, non-whites cannot dictate to me, my struggles because they are not my race. Why does no one ever address this?",1
A much needed podcast,06/04/2016,Sary1234,Excellent podcast that brings lots of different voices in.,5
Anecdotal garbage,06/04/2016,MdWwDm312,No real analysis or science or icky things like numbers or statistics. Why do that when we can just talk about our lived experiences and avoid any actual work? Typical identity politics dogma.,1

We need this conversation,06/05/2016,Chnvaldez,"I've read the negative reviews and come on, it's the first show. Isn't it intended to be an informal conversation? And it's one that we really need. White privilege is hard to see when you're white and surrounded by it and you take it for granted. I think the hosts did a very good job defining this. If you want more fire and anger (as justified as this is), this probably isn't the conversation for you. If you want a reasonable discussion and the ""conversation about race"", here you go. I'm so glad it's here.",5

Race at a white university,06/05/2016,barbieK14,"I got my degree is secondary education and one of the required classes was a class about race, it was taught by a black lesbian woman to a mostly white college. Everyone warned me that I would hate this class!! They would say that the professor had a huge agenda. She really didn't, she was just trying to get us to think about race and how it affected our teaching practices. She started by having us talk about our own culture and what that meant. All of us white kids did not even think we had a culture!! Seriously white people spend a lot of time pretending not to notice race, and pretending not have biases but we all have them! As a teacher I need to be self aware if I don't want to continue the pattern of ignoring race and not actively trying to sort out the biases that I have and fighting against them.",4
Fail,06/05/2016,Fezziksrock,"""Whiteness"". So, they're going to talk about culture and self identity right? Wrong! Even if you're all about white guilt and privilege, you will probably be disappointed. It was that bad.",1
Worth the wait!,05/31/2016,SMKM21,I've been excited for this podcast since hearing about it on other NPR podcasts I enjoy (NPR politics and Pop-culture happy hour).

Line up to be berated by a panel of people of color,06/01/2016,PattyJ,"I was surprised at how awful this podcast was. ""Can We Talk About Whiteness?"", they ask -- NO! Not like that, anyway. If they find it so hard to talk about a certain subject, maybe it's because they aren't very ""woke"" (to use their term) and have no idea what to say that might be insightful or true. So much arrogance and academic hubris, so little intelligent discussion. I know NPR listeners, especially white people, are supposed to line up to be berated by a panel of people of color, so that we can be punished for not having been treated badly by society -- but, no thanks.",1
Meh...,06/01/2016,WisdomSeed,"But then my expectations were kind of low. At least for the first show. I expect that this isn't the show for me because I am black and pretty jaded when it comes to efforts like this.

Awful,06/02/2016,EricFig,"Learned nothing from listening to this except for the fact that white people feel awkward about talking about being white. And, most of the 5 star reviews were given before the podcast even came out which should not happen.",1
Enjoyed the first episode,06/02/2016,actfilm,"Enjoyed the first episode. Looking forward to what's to come. The negative reviews are not surprising given the topic and given that people have difficulty discussing race. Also, it seems as if people are judging before listening. For example the review mentioning no ""Anglo"" voice when one of the professors was a white woman. I would encourage people to listen all the way through and if you feel angry or uncomfortable challenge yourself to think about why. We have deep racial issues in this country as evidenced most recently by the rise in hate crimes and Donald Trump. I am glad this podcast is creating a dialogue.",5

Segregation,05/12/2016,G_dforsaken,Okay I heard the trailer & it sounds like the program has great potential HOWEVER why is no Anglo voice also included? Shouldn't this voice be included to see how this large group reacts to the revelations of the other ethnic groups or is the white voice not wanted? This suggests to me the POSSIBILITY that the program can lapse into a discussion of 'political correctness' & 'microaggresion'. I shall try to listen with an open mind without superimposing my personal biases. I will review again after a few shows. I'm looking forward to learning.,3

Poor Production Quality,05/31/2016,DudewithShirts,"I expected more from NPR. The audio mixing is off, the commercial break feels jarring, the lack of a real structure, and the inability to complete the task of the episode.
