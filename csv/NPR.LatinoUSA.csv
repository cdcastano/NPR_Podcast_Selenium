This show is remarkable and vital to understand race diversity,04/27/2019,WrightsWords,"I dig Latino USA in ways that surprise me...! I mean it had segments on Danny Trejo and Grupo Fantasma, that last of which was new to me!",4
Dishonesty in reporting,04/26/2019,elzopilote2019,LatinoUSA recently doctored interviews and obfuscated who guests were in relation to their anti-chicanx editorial line on the events around the 50th anniversary MEChA conference. The continued disrespect that producers of NPR‚Äôs ‚ÄúLatino‚Äù programs show to chicanx and Mexican descent people is unacceptable.,1
Informative & enlightening,04/24/2019,GPhenom,"Though I'm black American, I try to stay informed of issues affecting the latinx community. Latino USA has impactful and well-told stories and topics. And the mixture of English and Spanish helps to challenge my fleeting Spanish language skills. Great job. I look forward to every episode.",5
Captivating,04/24/2019,AZ-BobbyG,I feel like I am sitting in Maria‚Äôs living room listening to a casual conversation that totally captivated me.

My Lighthouse,03/06/2019,fabiocanales,"In the stormy seas that political and racial conversations are today, especially as a latino from Honduras. This podcast has given me hope and awareness to be proud of my heritage. Even if an unkind word or disdainful looks hurt, I regain a sense of purpose to continue working hard and informing myself no matter what after each program. Thank you Maria Hinojosa & all the people that make it happen.",5
2 different shows please!,03/08/2019,5Babs5,I love your shows like the one I heard today on sexual assault in the detention facilities. I wish the cultural stuff was either a separate show or on a set schedule. I‚Äôm just not interested in that (I routinely delete Sam Sanders‚Äô Tuesday shows). I appreciate the stories your podcast brings to my life.,5
Real Journalism,03/12/2019,GreenHairedGirlFromSeattle,"I just listened to Latino USAs episode from the border in Texas. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for their on the ground journalism that seeks out real people to tell their stories and expose THEIR experiences. Latino USA always looks for the narrative or perspective that isn‚Äôt being told, even within stories that make national headlines. I also can‚Äôt say enough about their sister podcast In the Thick which is a laid back version of the news you care about from a POC perspective.",5
An Incredibly Moving Podcast,03/14/2019,Little Miss Sonshine :),This podcast sheds light on issues in latino america. It will challenge your beliefs and biases as well as educate you on problems you never knew existed. I believe everyone in America should listen to this podcast especially during these contentious times.

A fan in Hawaii,03/25/2019,joeyb808,"I love the topics, content, and especially the way the podcast keeps me connected to my roots. Living in Hawaii has its perks, but having a large Latino population is not one of them! Gracias por todo, adelante siempre.",5

Absolutely worth listening to,04/09/2019,NaomiS78,"I've been a long time listener.....and I mean a very, very long time! I love Maria Hinojosa has helped to create something incredibly special! This latest episode on being Asian AND Latino was remarkable. Growing up in El Paso, TX with a Mexican father and his extended family and a Korean mother definitely resonated with me!",5
Quince,04/11/2019,siena2020,Enjoyed all the shows thus far. What about a segment on a quince for a girl more American than Mexican and trying to keep the culture alive in her? My dilemma nowadays with my daughter Siena who has decided she want her quince.,5
"Engaging, Interesante & Inteligente",04/12/2019,fcrtscnd,"This podcast has been essential, a way to learn and understand the incredible multiplicity of the Latinx, Hispanic, Chicano, Nuyorrican and ever so evolving community. The stories are always changing and I am learning more and more. I really enjoyed themes I have not always wanted to read or be exposed to. The interview with Immortal Technique was fascinating, and I am not a rap fan, but this opened a door to that experience. These stories are fundamental and they are needed to give strength to la resistencia.",5
get a little cultured,04/12/2019,snow_bunny4,"i come from a mexican-hungarian background (mom hungarian dad mexican) but i look very white. before my parents divorce, my aunts, my grandma mita and other relatives on my dads side watched my little brother and i so i picked up a little spanish. growing up in a very white school i was made fun of because i would mix up my sentences. for example, instead of saying ‚Äòcan i have some ice water?‚Äô i would say ‚Äòcan i have some water of ice?‚Äô teachers didn‚Äôt have the patients for me so i was put into ‚Äòspecial reading classes‚Äô which only increased the bullying.",5
My heart is so much fuller,01/18/2019,sarahndipityyyy,Recently I moved back to the states after being in Peru this last year. It‚Äôs been hard at times adjusting back to life here. I went from spending all my days with Peruvians; speaking Spanish and loving all things Latin American to moving to a city in the states with not a large Hispanic population. I was trying to find ANYTHING really to fill that void and give me come comfort. And randomly I found this podcast. I‚Äôve listened to NPR on and off the last few years but I‚Äôve never been an avid listener...until now. As a gringa living in the south I‚Äôm so thankful to have this. It‚Äôs made me feel more connect also while continuing to open my eyes and give me a new perspective. From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU ‚ù§Ô∏è,5

Longtime listener ‚ù§Ô∏è,01/25/2019,Mudhoney6,"I‚Äôve been tuning in since the mid 90‚Äôs. Back when the only way to catch this podcast was via public radio scheduling. I would synchronize my time to take long drives while Latino USA was being aired via KPCC. Haven‚Äôt stopped except thanks to apps...I get to keep up on demand and revisit my faves. It‚Äôs rich narrative, excellent soundtrack (background music) and connection to everything Latino is superb. LOVE LOVE LOVE LATINO USA!!!!",5
Thankful,01/27/2019,Kahlo317,Beyond thankful for this podcast. Amazing content EVERYONE should listen to.,5
Love this podcast!,01/30/2019,eileenkimesq,"Thank you, Latino USA, for bringing to light these important stories about the Latinx community. I have been a faithful listener for the past year or so and have learned so much as a result of your wonderful storytelling. As an East Asian American, I know it is incumbent upon me to listen and learn from other communities of color, who have been disproportionately marginalized in this country. For me, listening to Latino USA is not just about information-gathering, though there is much to gather, or finding a temporary respite from the often monotonous legal world I work in; it is about identifying with our collective humanity and as a byproduct, being blessed - every time I listen - by the beauty, resilience, and hope the Latinx community exudes.",5
Thank you!,02/02/2019,kusalausa,"I love how Latino USA talks about the topics that we, latinos in this country, are talking about. Thank you guys for spreading the word on such important topics!",5
Entire show,02/03/2019,DefenderOfDemocracy,I‚Äôm so happy to have found this podcast that tells the stories and experiences of the Latinx community.

Thank you all who make this possible!,5
unsubscribe,02/04/2019,Maetzin la mera mera,had to unsubscribe after Maria Hinojosa‚Äôs softball ‚Äúquestion‚Äù regarding Gina‚Äôs anti-blackness. Gina has had deserved backlash against some of the comments she has made and it was disappointing to hear Maria not really acknowledge that. It is important that we as latinx are critical and hold our own people accountable for anti-blackness. Whether it‚Äôs a held view or a comment that should not have been made.,3
Love this podcast,02/07/2019,Garyslother,"This podcast encourages me and educated me. It‚Äôs the best one I have ever listened to and I listen to ALOT of podcast.
If you looking to educate yourself and open you eyes, this podcast is for you!",5
Not balanced,02/07/2019,DenDenX,Most of latinos arent liberal. All this podcast have been pushing using liberal talking points. Most shows have been extremely bias. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to any latino.,1
NAFTA and destruction of Mexico diet,02/08/2019,joannececilia,Very informative about how corporate international interests blame the individuals for their policies of land grabs from poor that lead to reducing affordable fresh produce access and resulting in the poor having diabetes etc. the poor in Mexico were much healthier pre- NAFTA!,5
More Straight Latino Males,02/08/2019,Rolandosgjb,I love the podcast. The topics are amazing and always leave me feeling inspired. The only thing I wish there was more of is straight Latino male role models. When a man is on the show he is either gay or has very feminine qualities. It feels like straight Latino men don‚Äôt have a voice on your show or aren‚Äôt a priority. I really enjoyed the Ruben Blades and Kid Mero episodes. If we can have more of those I would be extremely grateful and happy. Thank you for all the hard work you put into the show.,4
This rocks!!,02/08/2019,Kimmikimd,I love having a podcast that I can relate to! For a long time I always felt podcasts were hard to listen to because they contained predominantly ‚Äúwhite‚Äù content. This podcast allows me to stay connected with Latinx news/pop culture! I LOVE IT!,5
Motivation to get up at 6am!,02/09/2019,Narda Lelia,"Today, after a long time, I got up sort of early and got a chance to hear to the last part of the interview to Angela Aguilar.

There aren‚Äôt enough stars in the universe,12/19/2018,Mizzly Melly,"My friends have long been telling me to listen to a podcast, any podcast, for years‚Äî I‚Äôve never gotten around to it. Until today. A friend recommended Latino USA and the first episode to fill my ears was ‚ÄúAbuelos‚Äù. Oh my, the range of emotions I felt in just 30 minutes was, quite frankly, thrilling. I listened while getting ready for work and was so immersed I left my lunch on the kitchen counter. I‚Äôve listened to four more episodes today!",5
My soul is filled,12/19/2018,ms_stephanieeee,"Latino USA fills a void in my heart and soul. Latinos are looking for validation, guidance and compassion. This show provides that and I‚Äôm so grateful for all that Latino USA does for our people.",5
To feminists!?,12/20/2018,Raul Berron,"Perhaps, you should change your podcast title to ‚ÄúLatina USA‚Äù. 75% of your podcast seems to be directed to the female gender. Some times I need to just change the channel because the report has no relevance to me.",3
I feel like I belong.,12/20/2018,sangre j√≠bara,I was born here yet I always feel like I don‚Äôt fit or belong in the USA. Yet I go visit my parents home and I never quite fit there either .

Thanks for being on the air and sharing these experiences.,5
Brooklyn 99 Girls,01/08/2019,pepperjaci,Thank you Maria for all you do as a journalist but more as a Latina woman. You inspire me.,5
Struggle,01/09/2019,Luna Noemi,As a latina who ha struggles with her MEXICAN culture this show has a tremendously helped me. Why because I felt I had to always change my culture to a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù adaptation. Learned that my culture is Beautiful and do not need to change for other's politically correctness or comfort. Comfort because they don‚Äôt understand my roots. Thanks you Latino NPR for teaching me we are more. You guys are one of the many resources that have helped me.,5
Glad i discovered this,01/10/2019,Vgxp,I love this podcast. It keeps me connected with issues that are directly affecting Latinos. Matters I sometimes wasn‚Äôt even aware of. Just wish there was a spanish version to share with my parents- i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be tied to the speakers if so.,5

More empathy please.,01/06/2018,Delgado wife,"I enjoy Latino USA on TV and this is my first time listening to your podcast. My sister told me about your Puerto Rico death toll segment. I was bothered by your lack of empathy in reporting this serious topic. Laughter, fun music, and some sarcasm at times when talking about lives lost came across very cold and unsympathetic. I'd be embarrassed to share this particular title but look forward to hearing other stories. Please consider the topic being discussed in your interactions with the people and reporters.

Love this podcast!,01/20/2018,Melissa6500,"In the US in 2018, these stories and voices should be commonplace in the media, but unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the case. I love the topics and tone of the show.",5
"Fantastic content as always, but not a fan of the new format",02/05/2018,J.D.P.S.,"I've been listening to Latino USA for years, and I never miss a show. Episodes like the one about abuelas, the one about bodegas, and the one about the death of Jos√© de Jes√∫s are among my absolute favorite podcast episodes of all time. So I always recommend the show without hesitation. But I'm not liking the new 2018 format so much. Having only one story per episode rather than multiple pieces on a given theme makes me feel like I'm missing out on shorter yet important and interesting stories (like the one about TPS). I listen from Colombia, so there's no practical way for me to listen to the full show on public radio. So it would be nice if they either offered the full show as a podcast (rather than burying it in the website) as an alternative to the standalone pieces, or if they made good on their promise to put out many stories per week. Thanks!",3
5 Stars!,02/08/2018,jocasoi33,Great show. Incredibly diverse content coming from POC. A huge asset to the culture. Latino representation is a must and this show brings that to us!,5

Don't deport latino/a's, instead, deport white supremacist/nationalist! Enslavement, colonialization, genocide, and civil war wasn't done by people from Latin America, or Africa.

In 2016, our favorite podcast was the rock 'n roll one. Thank you for helping me expose my children to a larger world. We listened to the story of Sylvia Mendez and the struggles Mexican American students faced, we listened to the actress whose family was deported. This is how my daughter learned what ""deportation"" means. The stories make us learn and laught and sometimes I think, ""Oh . . . should the kids be listening to this person's story?"" but I have them listen to almost every single episode because I want my children to know realities outside of their own.

The host, Maria Hinajosa, is phenomenal and presents a show that makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you think, makes you consider your own influence in the web of humanity and culture. I'm a big believer in empathy through education, through history, through personal stories. Shows like these remind us of what we share as humans, reminds us of how history brings us to our present and forecasts the future. Shows like these make me want to know more, to be a better mother of Latinx children, to participate in improved experiences . This show makes me want to share the stories of struggle, of triumph, of diversity, of the fabric of our nation. Educators of Latinx children, I especially ask you to enjoy these podcasts to gain a perspective not often presented. Please listen and enjoy.",5

Listen today!,10/27/2016,Mountain 647,"This is where it all started for me! Latino USA covers so many issues affecting the Latino community and breaks it down so anyone not of Latino descent can easily understand certain references or cultural practices. The team led by Maria Hinojosa are all real journalists, so you know you are receiving well researched facts and events. Some episodes take many months to a year to put together. I recommend to everyone who will hear me! Listen today and you will not regret it!",5
Outstanding! !Maravilloso!,10/30/2016,Marialucgom,"I love listening to Latino USA when I'm at the gym--I take care of my body and my mind at the same time.

I'm a teacher living in Portland who grew up in small town, white Oregon and have been lucky to now be married to an amazing Mexican woman! She shared Latino USA with me and I have been an eager listener from the first episode I heard. I love how your show helps my wife stay connected to her roots in a culture that does not always make that easy, but also reaches and enlightens me to appreciate and understand a culture that is different from what I was raised in.

Validated,11/11/2016,LaElenita6707,"Latino USA makes me feel validated - that Latinos, their culture, their language, their stories, rights and well being matter to so many people besides me. Thank you for easing me despair after Donald Trumps election, and motivating me to keep fighting for equity for all people. A suggestion: I work in the field of Disability Studies, and would encourage you to look at the experiences of Latinos with disabilities and their families. It's a unique and often untold story worth our attention.",5

I recommend this podcast, con todo mi corazon!",5
I'm Hooked!,08/24/2016,MithMathy,"I recently heard the episode ""Latinos on the Reservation"" - and now I'm hooked! I grew up in rural eastern Washington state and went to college in Seattle, so I knew that a large number of Latinos worked on farms in the Yakima valley, but I didn't know what their relationship was with the Yakima people and the reservation (or even how the land was laid out!). I love the exploration of the intersection of different aspects of cultural identity like this.",5
Excellent podcast,08/24/2016,SeedyK,I enjoy listening for the different viewpoints this brings to me. It's clear that a lot of thought and effort goes into producing each podcast.

My husband and I are both returned Peace Corps volunteers from Latin America and when we returned to the USA, we were unable to have children. We then adopted two orphaned baby girls at the same time from Chihuahua, Mexico. Latino USA enriches all of our lives and helps us feel closer to our daughters' roots.

Extraordinario!,07/30/2016,SpainAGA,"I have been listening to Latino USA podcast from wherever I have been serving, being in the USAF and station overseas for years in Italy, Spain, Germany, Afghanistan, Bahrain and Oman. It helps me stay connected to my Latino and American roots, it always manages to move me, gives me that sentimiento of pride and joy of celebrating our multiculturalism. It certainly is a source of information that provides American listeners with a reminder of the contributions of Latinos to the USA, how much Latinos have contributed and will continue to contribute. It is entertaining, interesting and with lots of Latino flair... Love it!",5
"Such a thoughtful, engaging program.",07/30/2016,movieeewatcher22,I listen to a lot of nPR podcasts and so decided to try this one out a few weeks ago and am so glad I did! Such interesting stories and looks at media and representation. Keep up the good work!,5

my favorite news program,07/30/2016,kshelduff,"I wish every news program was as interesting, intelligent, funny, compassionate, diverse and democratic as Latino USA. I love the mix of perspectives: academic and streetwise, island and mainland, urban and rural, old and young. Every voice is treated as valuable - and that's a rarity in our day and age. Thank you Latino USA!",5
Relatable but not novel,08/02/2016,DRCovarr,"This is one of the only podcasts out there that is relatable to Latinos in the US. It is often comforting and inspiring, but rarely is it novel or intriguing. Episodes are long and cover topics that are typically of interest to Latinos but that are so over-discussed that rarely does anyone add something different or interesting to say. I like the episodes that talk about obscure Latino history, culture, or little known important Latino leaders. I do not like the episodes that repeat popular discourse or opinion. Please feature more novel topics! We US Latinos are interested in way more than just immigration, soccer, injustice, and Spanglish. Talk about our countries of origin, our rich cultural and political history, and modern everyday Latino leaders and heroes (beyond the usual Sotomayor, Castro brothers, and Lin-Manuel Miranda). Cover stories about our community's victories not just oppression. Highlight uncommon but important intersectionality stories, like Latinos in science or Latino-Black empowerment.",4
Awesome!,08/03/2016,Vlad_Rod,"This podcast is great. It really brings to light some of the issues the Latino community faces and may not always be discussed by the mainstream media. I always find myself empowered, motiviated, and informed after listening to it. I do highly recommend you listen to this. It's truly great.",5
JRJimenez CA,08/04/2016,JRJimenez CA,"I just love this show. As a white Spanish teacher, wife of an Afro-Latino, and future mother of Mexican Americans, this show really educates me to understand the different dynamics in my life. Topics are discussed that people don't normally include me in, and certain topics that are important in Latino lives suprise me. I feel like this show helps me be a better teacher, wife, mother and citizen.",5
Every ep is interesting and important,08/05/2016,Chnvaldez,I can't say enough about Latino USA. Simply the best.,5
Latino USA is must listen programming!,08/06/2016,Chococherri,"I really enjoy this show! There is a breadth of topics covered and it's both entertaining and informative. As a non-Latinx POC, I also appreciate that they include the many different faces of the diaspora and their struggles and triumphs.",5
Not just for Latinos. Great diversity,08/12/2016,Valentin photo,This is one of the few podcasts that I have continued to listen to since the day I downloaded six years ago.

Excelente,06/26/2016,J en DC,"Keep up the great work. I am not a Latino myself but have spoken Spanish and English all my life. I enjoy LatinoUSA for its unique voice and in-depth reporting--perhaps the only place to go for a hyphenated perspective. It's the kind of thing that gets me charged to do well during the week, and I often recall certain segments of the program throughout the week. I may not be able to convince everyone to listen, but I can share the stories and sentiments where ever I go.",5

One of the bests podcasts,07/11/2016,Lvms91,"Simply put, this is one of the best podcasts I've ever listened to. Topics run the gamut - from serious issues like politics, current events and immigration, to lighter topics like simple miscommunications in bilingualism, life in the day of a bodega and scary Latin American legends (think La Llorona). While this podcast has certainly helped me to embrace my LA/Caribbean roots, I would recommend this podcast to every and anyone that will listen. The topics, conversations and conclusions transcend cultural, racial, national, even regional boundaries.",5
Wonderful,07/12/2016,_onitsuj,"Glad I stared listening and sad that I missed out for so long. Excellent podcast - well produced, interesting and educational.

Latino USA speaks my truth,07/16/2016,anhelacob,"Like any Latinx, I have always wanted to see myself reflected in the news, or in the dominant cultural narrative of this country. Through in depth stories and high quality journalism about the Latinx community, this podcast speaks the truth to power. As a Mexicana, it also allows me to learn about other Latinx cultures in our diverse community. I recommend this podcast to all of my other teacher and organizer friends. I can't wait for the next episode! -Angela in Denver",5
Top Notch,07/19/2016,filicana,"I love this show so much. The content is really innovative, the contributors are talented, and I really appreciate Maria Hinojosa's casual and warm tone.

Mi ventana,07/23/2016,"Uplifting, real, hope :)","This podcast opens up connection to the Latino world that's obviously real, but hidden to those of us ""outside it"". I am a 30 year old white woman, but have always loved the language and culture and since serving in the Peace Corps in Panama I am so grateful for something back home that illuminates current, relevant, and topical issues in modern day so that I can understand just a little bit about what's going on in my own country related to the topic and how Latinos think and feel about them. The show is smart, honest, funny, beautiful, sassy, empathetic, and challenging.

Finally touching base with my roots,07/26/2016,Second Chance?,"On my father's side, my Abuelo and Abuela were Spanish speaking immigrants to the States - from Costa Rica and Puerto Rico respectively. Sadly, Abuelo died before I was born and Abuela died when I was 4, so I never knew them. And, my father never spoke Spanish or about his upbringing. So, I never really had exposure to the Latino culture nor thought of myself as Latino. But this podcast has helped me to start to connect with and understand those who I am connected to through the Abuelo and Abuela I never knew. It has also helped me to understand more about the struggles of those who are Spanish-speaking and/or non-whites in the States. Thank you for helping me to widen my view of the country I grew up in and those that make it more diverse and special.",5
Phenomenal Journalism,07/26/2016,JesseValdez,"Just phenomenal journalism all around. They are thoughtful, intelligent, and thorough in their stories.

The more I listen, the more I discover about my own identity, my role in the US, the need to participate, and the historical success and atrocious misjudments and injustices that have been done against the latino and other minority communities. I was raised with a single identity, and I am learning to accept the multiple identities I and many Americans contain, and be proud about it without shame.",5
My Weekly Must-Listen!,06/20/2016,ElKikillo,I discovered Latino USA a few months ago and I am hooked. I listen every week and am making my way through the catalogue of previous episodes. There are very few shows that portray the Latino community beyond stereotypes. Latino USA is one of those shows. The stories hit home as a first-generation Mexican -American. I will continue listening and telling everyone to listen as long as the episodes keep coming. Gracias!,5
Must Listen for Curious Latin Americans,06/22/2016,YoungLatina20,As a president of a Latino Organization at my university I am so grateful for this podcast. It allows me to better educate myself in order to make sure I am better educating the members of my organization.,5
Latino USA,06/23/2016,Nanekie,Absolutely on point! I can't get enough knowledge and stories about Latinos for Latinos.,5
Wonderful,06/25/2016,AngeMM,This by far is one of the best podcast! I have enjoyed every episode and I have learned so much. Maria Hinojosa is a wonderful journalist. It is great to get so many point of views with topics that affect our community or topics that we didn't even know were related to us.,5
For Everyone,04/15/2016,Boombar44,"As a non-Latino I may not necessarily belong to the demographic this show targets, but it's really good, entertaining and informative if you want to stay on top of current U.S. affairs of which Latinos are no small part.",5
This is for Everybody,04/15/2016,Pearlkabra,"Check it out! If you are an American, this is for you. You will learn about your own history and culture whatever background you are from, we are all connected and Latino USA makes this even more obvious. Also, there is always awesome music that runs the gamut, stories about topics that many of us are thinking about but don't get addressed in many programs, and thoughtful conversations about the important issues of our time. (P.S. Latino USA, please name your music producers during the show tell us where we can get those awesome tracks)",5
One of the greatest Latinx NPR shows ever!,04/19/2016,ed_fl0,"Professor Hinojosa does a great job in shedding light to some of the most important topics that need to be discussed as it relates to Latinxs. Now this may be a vague and quite intensive subject to discuss based on how vast the Latinx community is, but Latino USA does not disappoint with the great stories they present to us each and every week!",4
Got to have this,04/19/2016,El Artemesia,I drive about an hour to work in traffic everyday. Thank goodness for this pod cast. It has made my commute so much better. The show is new but it's quickly becoming my favorite cast for me to listen too. Can't wait for he next episode :),5
Capturing the Latino experience in the US,04/20/2016,FranciscoNC,"Latino USA is fantastic! Whether you're Latino or not, you should take a listen! As a gay, undocumented immigrant with a disability living in the U.S., rarely do I get to hear stories that remotely get close to the same journey or experience that I have had while living in this part of the world--far away from home. The stories shared in this podcast asre so genuinely diverse and beautifully unique. It's great to know that the Latino USA staff recognizes the broadness of what it means to be Latino; queer, mixed race, and to even acknowledge gender and our broad political perspectives as Latinos. Hearing about the Dreamers have made me cry, learning about queer Latinos in the Stonewall raids has made me proud, and hearing all the different Spanish accents has made me smile. If they start incorporating more stories of atheist and secular Latinos, I'll smile even brighter! Gracias Latino USA. We are listening.",5
my favorite in awhile!!,04/21/2016,Anaukweli,"I‚Äôve been in England studying abroad and my heart lit up as soon as I heard Maria Hinajosa‚Äôs voice. I‚Äôm a mixed Black American girl, and being in London (although a really diverse city) there aren‚Äôt a lot of Latino people around compared to back home in the US. The podcasts have their own rhythmic quality‚Äîthey‚Äôre just really really nice to listen to with the mix of voices, stories, and amaaaazing music. The podcasts feels homey and warm, they remind me of home, and I always learn something new or about somebody new and feel inspired to keep pushing for social change. The stories are varied, unique, interesting, and important. The first episode I heard was the Afro-Latino episode, and the stories there were an opening into a huge world of experiences, stories, and people that I can relate to as a Black American. I‚Äôve listened to so many episodes since, and I absolutely love Latino USA! Thank you all for your work to give space to the voices of Latino people and your stories. I think everybody should listen! I love seeing people of color doing amazing things like you all, and it inspires me to keep pushing for change for our intermixed communities of color and to push for solidarity among us all. Much love and many blessings to you all!",5
Informative,04/23/2016,indecente,Be informed. Listen to NPR Latino. Whether you're latino or not this podcast gives so much.,5

Life-changing & Eye-opening,05/01/2016,enchilad33,"I‚Äôll never forget Sonia Sotomayor saying that the only thing holding young Latinos back was fear of failure. To never be intimidated in the face of anyone. Latino USA feel simultaneously like getting advice from my favorite tia and like hearing bright, innovative ideas. Familiar and exciting all at once. I‚Äôm so grateful for it every week. It never feels to make me feel more in sync with my cultura and my future. Thank you so so so much for the work you do.",5
Essential,05/02/2016,Buttface Nosebleed,"Absolutely wonderful storytelling, perspectives, and thoughtful engagement. There‚Äôs far too little mainstream media attention to us Latinx folks, and this podcast is a glorious voice above the din of mass culture.",5
Great show,05/03/2016,Moppy642000,"This show is wonderful and should be heard by any Hispanic who wants to learn about our history and culture that we are not taught in school. Views can be opposing and go both ways, from time which is good, because you should hear both sides to form an opinion.",5
If stories had soundtracks,05/05/2016,Velez Mixtape,"Have you ever wanted an essay or book to have a soundtrack? Latino USA does that. The host, Maria Hinojosa arranges stories like if they were coming from that high school teacher you really liked and paid attention to. The stories and topics are often accompanied by music at the beginning or end of the segments and collectively present the story in a great way",5
Love it,05/08/2016,Boricawpb,Great podcast.,5
Finally!,05/10/2016,Eric Remly,"This is exactly what I've been looking for. As the son of Latinos, I found it hard to keep up with current events because I was raised in NY. The only Spanish outlets available to me while growing up were the two television stations that ran an almost unending stream of talk shows and telenovelas. I stuck to my American programming as a result.",5
¬°Excellente!,05/12/2016,SweetSugarBooger,Wonderful podcast. Excellent information that is relevant and entertaining.,5

Latino USA rocks!,05/16/2016,AfroLatinx,Maria Hinojosa and her team are one of my favs on NPR. It pains me that WAMU have this show scheduled at 6 am on Saturdays but I culturalize myself with this podcast. Thank you for showcasing the AfroLatino experience as well as all other parts of the Latino culture. Gracias MH!,5
One of the best,03/07/2016,ohlakesidegirl,I hear stories on Latino USA that I don't hear anywhere else (pretty sure that's one of their tag lines). I adore this show and I'm trying to work my way through the back catalog. I became fluent in Spanish as an adult and work for a public library as a bilingual employee and I consider this podcast an important way to learn more about the many cultures of my Latino customers.,5
Love it,03/07/2016,JM in LA,"I have nothing to add to all the positive reviews below, except to say that only a dimwit and/or a Klan member wouldn‚Äôt enjoy this podcast.",5

Gracias,03/19/2016,Maestra Wilson,"I am a bilingual European-American woman who has worked as an educator with Latinos for 15 years. This podcast is soothing to my soul. I enjoy the code switching, the variety of topics, the educated and passionate voices and Maria Hinojosa's proud accent. As the numbers of Latinos increases and their influence grows I like thinking I am getting a peek into the dominant culture that is coming soon to these United States.",5

I absolutely love this podcast and have so much respect for those committed to bringing delight and education to the Latino community and beyond!,5
My Fav Podcast,03/31/2016,Mannix2020,"I love this podcast. Its so refreshing to hear a podcast that pertains to my cultural background and explores issues and history that have affected my community. I also really appreciate when you explore both sides of an issue, sometimes it's good to hear what people who don't necessarily have my viewpoint think. My daughters love to listen with me and we often have discussions about the various topics. Thank you for providing interesting and informative topics that really get people thinking and help provide understanding of our culture.",5
I cannot stop listening.,03/31/2016,Chuyloco187,"I recently discovered Latino USA and I have a lot to catch up on. All the topics are interesting and engagging. This show resonates with me culturally, politically and emotionally. My favorate episode so far is #1552-Abuelos. The stories made me think about my own abuelos and their stories. I am going to recomend this podcast to all my students in my Math classes. Thank you NPR for bringing the Latino voice.",5
One of my favorites!,04/10/2016,Mrs.0p3,I'm a huge NPR fan and this is a great addition to the NPR line up. I'm a Puerto Rican/Cuban female and I will say that it's refreshing to find a podcast that gives Latinos a voice! I look forward to hearing your new episodes.,5

Thank You Latino USA!,04/12/2016,Dance.Love,"Growing up in Southwest Florida in a small town, predominately made up of white Americans, I always struggled to understand myself and my culture as a Mexican-American. My parents immigrated into the United States, and believed that it was easier to assimilate into society rather than to stand proud and celebrate their national identity. I had a difficult time understanding who I was and how to fully embrace my Mexican identity. Listening to Latino USA has allowed me to learn more about myself and my culture, in a way that was never before presented to me.",5
Great insight,04/13/2016,EstebanMcK,"This podcast always covers interesting topics that you most likely wouldn't hear discussed outside of an ethnic studies college program, as well as local and regional issues with national implications. Always something new to learn!!!!",5
"Latino, are you kidding me???",04/13/2016,JohnIPena,"Seriously, if you have any kind of Lantino, Hispano, Mexicano, Cubano or any kind of ""O"" in your bloodline you need to be listening to the Podcast. Everyweek the content is golden and the music they use to bring you in and out of segments is WaaaAAAaaaay on point. If you ever need a big brother or sister or that smart cousin that always has good and real stories you've got it in Latino USA. Boom-Chacalaca, even if you do not have the ""O"" in your blood the information you get from listening will help you broaden your cultural awarenss. You've got to admit, we could all use some cultural awareness. You feel me my brothers and sisters? So don't wait, do yourself a favor and do this UP!",5
Speaking the truth,04/13/2016,Kuya.Rico,"I listened to nearly every episode and they all resonate with me. Latino USA makes relevant many topics that before I did not find relatable to me. Thanks Latino USA for speaking the truth on a wide range of topics. I especially liked the Through the Fire as my father has had chronic pain for over 7 years, I almost felt you were talking about him in the episode.",5
Latino‚Äôs Have a Voice,02/01/2016,RickyMo5,"I recently found the Latino USA radio program and have been engaged in the thought provoking content and the measured way in which it is delivered. With so many disappointing media outlets this is a shinning star in journalism. As the author Richard Ramos writes, Latinos for far too long have been on the margins rather than the mainstream. This type of programming provides a bridge to both Latino and American issues that intertwine so many of our lives. Thank you!",5

My favorite show,02/17/2016,ELLTeacherNicole,"Latino USA is my teacher, friend, and confidant every day.

Thank you,02/17/2016,Jhannyn flores,Just when you think you are the only one thinking of the struggles our community faces Latino USA goes deeper into the true understanding of who we are as a Latino force.

I have to say every week I fall in love with the team a little more and I can honestly say that if I ever met you all in person, I would give each of you un abraso muy grande! Un abraso for all the times I felt like you were telling my story to the world and speaking directly to me at the same time. Un abraso for every time I forgot I was stuck in traffic and truthfully didn't care (that alone has added years to my life, se lo juro). But most importantly, un abraso for every time my perspective was broadened and the basic human feeling connecting us all of empathy was strengthened within me.

Can't get enough.,03/06/2016,Mbn819,"I appreciate this program for the multiple perspectives it offers on issues facing Latinos, its relevancy in life today, and I also rely on it as a news source when other programs seem to look the other way from Latin America.

"Eclectic, Relevant, and Entertaining!",01/10/2016,Ricardeux,"Latino USA makes it easy for you to keep on listening. Each episode is as intriguing as the last, whether they speak about political themes such as immigration and deportation, or something personal like the lives of Latino/a/x grandparents. I listen because it informs me about how complex the life of a Latino/a/x can be, not only spanning different countries, but ideologies and traditions as well.",5
Essential Listening for everyone in politics,01/16/2016,Travis Ba.,"This is absolutely essential for anyone working in politics to listen to. This is such a unique and high-quality insight into one of the fastest growing demographics in the United States.

Latino USA changed my life,01/23/2016,ILOVEMariaHinojosa,"The journalists and producers of Latino USA have inspired me to pursue a career in social work with Spanish speaking populations of the U.S., work on the border and in migrant shelters, and in immigration reform for more humane policies. This show has kept me up to date on the latest news and perspectives on these issues and more, while also offering up other interesting and more lighthearted topics on Latino culture.

JVNun,01/27/2016,JVNun,"I look forward to this show at the end of the week. I started listening to this podcast to feel a deeper connection to my Latino roots, and hopefully see what it means to be Mexican American. Which is something that I was unsure of growing up.

Great stories about Hispanic community,01/29/2016,Rum Raisin,"I do not have a chance to interact with other Hispanics on a regular basis. Latino USA keeps me informed about topics and stories not notmally found in other media outlets. I always look forward to Maria Hinojosa's voice, whether the story is sad or uplifting.

But its just not the Latino aspect, its the family, its the religions, its the cultures across the board. In more then one of these episodes, I‚Äôve found myself shedding a tear because the topic hit home. I‚Äôve started listening to Metalachi because of this podcast! You should make a second podcast with short stories of Latino Culture/folklore/History.",5

Un poco de nuestro,12/11/2015,Fp&se,"I commute longer than most--1 hour, 20 minutes each way from home to work. With Latino USA I have laughed, I have sung along with the program, I have cried, I have even become angry (not at Latino USA, but because of serious violations of social justice that Latino USA brings to our attention). However, I have never fallen asleep. I learn so much from each podcast. No matter what the theme or topic that Maria Hinojosa covers in any one particular podcast, I always feel like there are incredible heroes and sheroes all across America who are making our world a better place. What is really inspiring about Latino USA is that it is about people who sound just like some of the people in my own family. Regardless of whether or not you are Latin@, if you are looking for a little bit of sabiduria (knowledge), and are open to inspiration that will motivate you to make your small slice of the world better, then this is a podcast worth following!",5

Admittedly, I have a few connections to Latinos: I taught for six years in a majority-Latino school in the Bronx and my girlfriend is a Chicana who was born in Mexico City and grew up in LA. That being said, what I love about this podcast is that it‚Äôs really a podcast about America. Through Latino USA I learn about American society as a whole, with a particular lens and focus on Latino issues. I highly recommend this pod for anyone who wants to learn specifically about the (many) Latino communit(ies), or more broadly about diverse people form a particular collection of backgrounds experiencing life in American society.",5

Always Excellent!,12/26/2015,ramos1215,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this podcast. I love tuning in every week to see which angle of the incredibly diverse Latino community Maria is going to explore. I will never forget the first time I listened to the Abuelos episode. My wife and I were driving a moving van through Texas on our way back to California. She was pregnant with our first child and we were going to be living close to my parents when we moved back to San Diego. With the thoughts of our son‚Äôs Mexican abuelitos on my mind already, that episode brought me to tears. It made it so hard to drive! I want to thank Maria Hinojosa and her team from the bottom of my heart for telling our communities' stories with such warmth and professionalism. This podcast is a treasure!",5

Thank you Latino USA,11/28/2015,Nelson_Arias,"I‚Äôm a Latino from California who has family living in the in the golden state, New York, Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. As for me, I am far away from it all in the Middle East‚Äîwhere I work. When I load Latino USA on my phone, as I drive to work, lie in bed during the morning, or just as my Mother showed me to clean and listen to the radio loudly, I feel like I am having a taste of home that I miss so much. Latino USA is put together very well and the content really presents many of the topics Latinos experience across America. I also learned of issues I never knew about, such as the episode of Latinos living in the Indian reservation.",5
Amazing!,11/28/2015,Fawnapril,One of my favorite podcasts. Great news and storytelling--so gripping and entertaining. I so appreciate hearing the wide variety of experiences of Latino Americans left out of much of mainstream media. They also delve into the intersections between many cultures. The host and reporters are so great at connecting with people and helping us connect with their experiences--and then place those experiences in larger social contexts. I wish this podcast were required listening for all politicians on the national level.,5

It is fantastic and I love sharing the stories with my latino friends and family. I also really enjoy hearing my non latino friends say they LOVE the podcast and can‚Äôt wait to hear the next one. These stories, and the lessons within them, cross cultural boundaries and provide a rich, complex and dynamic insight of US Latino culture and their national and international intersections.

Ay Vey,12/08/2015,David N O,As a Latin Jew (or as my wife calls me ‚Äúa Chicano Yid‚Äù) I thought the broadcast was right on.

I eagerly look forward to listening each week and I cannot speak highly enough of this program!",5
Fantastic show,11/08/2015,Latina Doula in NYC,"These guys are doing some amazing reporting and storytelling. As a Latina who loves to listen to podcasts I was so happy to find one that recognized the importance of the stories that fall under the radar. Often time I will be listening on the subway or while riding my bike and laugh out loud, cry like a baby, or get incensed at an injustice I had not heard about on the news. I feel proud to be a Latina, daughter of an immigrant when I listen to this show. It confirms what I have always felt, that we are a diverse group with so many stories to tell.

Connected to Our Culture,11/09/2015,monica_vega,"I stumbled across this on my local NPR station about two years ago. I have to say, it‚Äôs a game changer. Latino USA has connected my identity as a Xicana to the multicultural form of journalism. I‚Äôve heard stories about culture, food, music, art, history and popular culture. LUSA also covers tough topics like immigration reform, queer politics, discrimination, sexism, and education. With heart, humor and great research and reporting, I feel like this is the podcast I‚Äôve been waiting for my whole life! I‚Äôm also happy with the new 60 minute format. I‚Äôve discovered some of my new favorite writers, musicians, comedians, books and TV shows through this podcast. The show informs me, and like it‚Äôs topics, I am growing.",5
Missing My Culture,11/10/2015,Desireeables,"I went back to San Antonio recently from Seattle and realized just how much I was missing the feeling of being immersed in Latino culture.

Excellent!,10/14/2015,roberto ruben,Latino USA is my go-to during my 6 hour drives from miami to gainesville and back several times a year. I catch up on several episodes at once and this program never disappoints! It's so well constructed and executed and always keeps my attention. The last piece I heard was the interview with Selenis Leyva (Gloria from OITNB) which had me on the verge of tears. Excellent radio programming!!!,5
Amazing Podcast,10/14/2015,Alfredo Glove,"This is a great podcast. It's relevant and dynamic. As a Latina/o listener I can't remember the last time I crossed a show that so effortlessly bring together the heterogeneity of the Latin@ experience in the U.S. The themes are fantastic and timely, easily keeping you engaged throughout the show.

AN ABSOLUTE MUST LISTEN!,10/15/2015,ThePodCastLatino,"I could go on and on about how INCREDIBLE this podcast IS but I'll keep it sweet and simple: LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST. It doesn't matter what your nationality or background is this is an exceptionally produced, awesomely documented, incredibly fascinating and beautifully well put podcast. Yes, it will undoubtedly strike a stronger chord w you if you're Latino or have a Latino background. But this podcast should be listened to by EVERYONE. ""Informative"" still feels like an understatement. This show is Pulitzer Prize worthy. Everyone involved should be beyond proud of the work they do for each and every episode. I hope this podcast reaches #1 on the charts and stays there for a ridiculous amount of time. Please give this podcast a listen (you'll get hooked) and support NPR & Latino USA.",5
Eye-opening,10/16/2015,JLNeem,"I'm an Asian-American and my fianc√© is Puerto Rican. I learned Spanish but still felt a disconnect between my own heritage and his. Latino USA has been eye-opening and although we have distinct differences between our own cultures, we realized that there are many similarities. I hope to help our future children be comfortable with both cultures and Latino USA will definitely be an integral part of that.",5
It makes me feel closer to my roots,10/16/2015,Eir93,"As a third generation latina in the united states, I'm losing my roots, but Latino USA helps me stay connected. This podcast tells the important stories you won't hear anywhere else, and we need to help keep this representation up",5

Living the American Dream in Kuwait,10/22/2015,ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿàÿ±ŸäŸÇŸä,"I am a Puerto Rican who lived a long time in the US and even served in the US Military. My family moved to the US to live the so called ""American Dream"" when I was 6 months old. To be completely honest we never saw that dream come fruition. It took my father taking a job here in Kuwait and then me following him to be able to live that dream. Here after a couple of years of working and saving money I opened the first Puerto Rican restaurant in the Middle East. It has not been easy but definitely easier and better than when we lived in the US. Atleast in Kuwait being Latino is not considered a bad thing.",5

Truly Inspiring,09/16/2015,DeeskieMartinez,"I‚Äôve been an avid listener to Latino USA for the past two years since I‚Äôve subscribed to the podcast. I also listened to its segments on NPR previous to subscribing. It is an integral part of my morning routine. Maria Hinojosa is amazing! I received my BA in Latin American/Latino Studies from UIC in 2009 and have been craving access to the issues I was once so passionate about. Latino USA has really helped me stay up to date on issues involving not just Latinos, but all people of color. Its segments are well thought out and extremely entertaining. As a high school history teacher now, it was provided me with not just an alternative news source, but also strong narratives that I am able to bring to the classroom. Great job to all those at Latino USA!",5
Trans-inclusive Programming,09/19/2015,readj,"Latino USA is my favorite podcast for two reasons. The first is that I haven‚Äôt heard any other show that covers so much cultural diversity. I work in early intervention and am in graduate school to become a mental health counselor, and this kind of hands-on real life reporting helps me to become better at both. The second reason Latino USA is my favorite podcast is that no other show does a better job of covering trans and queer issues in a real way. I am a young, white, queer transman and even shows like ‚ÄúAll Things Considered‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath, Sex, and Money‚Äù make me feel like an outsider in the way they cover issues relevant to my life. Thank you, Latino USA, for covering my stories and showing trans and queer people the dignity and respect we deserve. It has been life-changing. (I also just donated, and if you are reading this and are able, you should to!)",5

I am a radio buff‚Ä¶ but Latino USA is one of those shows I get excited for every time a notification pops up on my phone. It‚Äôs well produced, focuses on a wide variety of issues, and I like the fact that it‚Äôs not trying hard to be a ‚Äúpan-Latino‚Äù show, simplifying this rich community. Instead, Maria and her team highlight stories that show the complexity and diversity of the Latino community.

If only EVERYONE listened to this show...,08/16/2015,Carmentierra,"I am latina, so it‚Äôs not a BIG surprise that I love this show, but more importantly‚Ä¶ I think this show educates non-Latinos on Latino culture, and firmly believe that the awareness and education that comes from listening has the potential to break down walls, foster understanding, and ultimately eliminate the hatred and racism that we face every day.",5

When Worlds Collide,09/10/2015,wqroiwqjodndskfgoerg,I teach at a large high school (over 2500 students) and the majority of the students have a diverse ethnicity. This podcast really helps a middle aged white guy like me to better understand their world and get out of mine. Thank you!!,5

Best pod cast ever,07/16/2015,Kingjajay,Ms. Maria thanks for the great information that you have provided me with and I've recently began a project on Latinos coming to America and I would love to be able to ask you some questions thank you so much and continue the great work,5

I recommend this show for all who have a Hispanic/Latino background and/or who are interested in Hispanics and Latinos!",5
Very Entertaining and Educational,07/22/2015,Indie and Chocolate,"This is my favorite podcast. I love that it talks about current events and also history and culture, everything from music to pop culture to politics, social issues and more, in Latin American countries and also USA. The stories offer unique insights from a wide range of people, and I often connect with them emotionally or take away new information.

Best Program of Its Kind,07/29/2015,RuuIsk34,"To date, Latinos are VERY often left out of important national conversations on race, gender, society, etc. American media is all too often quite literally ""black and white"" without any acknowledgement of the unique unique and increasingly dynamic experience that is being a Latino in the United States. So for me, and many others, this podcast is a godsend. It's not a political podcast, an entertainment podcast, a historical podcast, or really any genre-specific podcast: it's Latino USA. It covers anything and everything that happens within the Latino community, and they've been doing it for years! As the Latino community grows larger in the coming decades, more media organizations are going to try to jump on the bandwagon and produce similar content (which is good), but Latino USA will ALWAYS be my go-to, #1 source for an accurate and compelling weekly look into the my national Latino community and everything that makes it what it is. Keep up the phenomenal work!",5

Such an AH-maaaaaazing Show,08/02/2015,C.Vickie,"It is rare to find any sort of media that discusses Latin and Caribbean issues from a nuanced point of view, and as an Afro-Caribbean woman we are often lumped in with Black Americans and our issues are ignored. Therefore, it is great to have a program like this that discusses issues that affect our community. Not only does Latino USA give you alternative views into Latino issues but it also discusses art, culture, religion and various other topics. They also give other minorities a voice. They discuss affirmative action not just from black vs white perspective that has always been the focus of traditional American media but from the perspective of Asian Americans. They did a whole section on Japanese internment camps and large Asian populations in Latin American countries. They discuss colorism in Latin American countries and what it's like to be an Afro-Latina woman both in Latin America (specifically Cuba and the Dominican Republic) as well as in the United States (where the only Latinas who get any are validated and get exposure are fair skinned Latinas ala Sofia Vergara (and even she had to darken her naturally blonde hair to be seen as a viable Latina woman.",5

Great job!,06/21/2015,InWashingtonDC,"I wish there were more podcasts like this. Suggestion, June is LGBT pride month.

A Breath of Fresh Air,06/27/2015,üíÉüèΩüôåüèæüéâ,"So I am an Afro Latina who listens to many podcasts and often find myself feeling resentful about the topics of discussion and the environment, it often feels like a ‚Äúwhite space.‚Äù This podcast provides an escape from that with topics that are relevant and important being addressed by Latino people, thus taking away that feeling of an other looking into the experiences of the Latino Community in the US. In short, this is really meaningful work and resonates with me very much. THANK YOU!!!!",5

Latino USA has helped me become a more educated person by covering important stories and perspectives rarely present in mainstream media.

A Window of Optimism,07/14/2015,PdChat,"Latino USA gives voice to so many vibrant, often young, voices talking about the good, bad, and ugly of their experiences and interests, especially women.

Definitely worth checking out,06/10/2015,User1001101,"The range of topics and level of depth they cover is amazingly creative. I appreciate how the hosts clarify themselves carefully throughout the program and don't force the Latino label into a singular definition.

I've been filling my commute times with TED talks and Reggaeton, and now I've found something that much better. Latino USA is a profound storytelling platform for an audience commonly ignored.

So thought provoking,04/21/2015,Jason Shade,This show is always fascinating and engaging. I am not of Latino origin but I enjoy learning more about what it means to be Latino in America. The stories of barriers and discrimination ring true with me as a member of the LGBT community. This show reminds me of This American Life but has a distinct identity and style of its own. Maria Hinojosa is great host with a lot of heart and personality.,5
Love It!,11/21/2008,Msafiri,"I really enjoy the show. The stories are interesting and informative and I love the host Maria Hinojosa. I'm not Latino and don't speak Spanish, so it's my main source for news and issues affecting the Latino community.",5
"Highly Offensive, biased and spewing of racial hatred.",01/24/2009,7A0455,This program seems almost to cast racists and those who seek to promote themselves to positions of power in a harmless almost sympathetic light.

An informative and representative broadcast of Latino experience in the US and around the world,08/16/2009,mywanderingheart,As a non-Latina Spanish speaker and educator I believe that any means by which I can educate and inform myself and my students about issues important to Latinos and Latino culture in the US and around the world to be a very valuable resource. This podcast contextualizes current events with a Latino viewpoint as well as provides insights into different cultural aspects of various Latino communities. I will use excerpts from this podcast in my classroom and hope that my students will learn more about this rich and varied cultural heritage and that they are able to appreciate all that the Latino culture adds to our experience in the US.,5

I constantly read the headlines from major news stations and their report of Latinos doesn't compare. Yes, LatinoUSA reports on immigration (like everyone does) but it doesn't make it it's focus. It shows you through different news segments just how connected and empowered the Latino community is worldwide. And that, my friend, I haven't found anywhere.",5
DePaul Love,01/06/2011,DePaulSenior2011,"After listening to Ms. Hinojosa Speak at DePaul's 2010 Commencement ceremony I decided to check out the podcast because her passion and amazing words of wisdom. Now I cannot stop listening and have become so encouraged as a Latina to continue to strive for what I believe. My heart goes out to all of my friends and students who were counting on the DreamAct to pass, and I encourage them and everyone to also continue fighting. Como decimos, ""Si Se Puede!"" I love this channel and the true diversity that it showcases about the Latino culture. I love love love the Latino Media clip, and as a Latino Media minor it has become such a great resource. Thank you. :)",5
Great show but poor online management,08/18/2011,AndrewinPA,"As a Latino living in an area where there are precious few of us, I love this show for helping me stay in touch with the issues that are faced by the broader community. It's always a delight and there's always something interesting to learn from each show.",3
Lo mejor,01/06/2012,Alessandro Maione,Me encanta este programa. Las inrevistas siempre son interesantes.,5
The future of America,05/25/2013,eye_day,It's so wonderful to have this show on the air. It's not available on my local NPR station so I'm very happy to have it available via podcast. The issues presented are often difficult to sort out but they are crucial and Maria explores the complexities.,5
So thankful.,10/22/2014,BartJHoney,"While any news is good news, one geared toward me and my young family is much appreciated. With a multicultural household (me Hispanic and my wife French) it is nice to be able to have something unique to share with my son.",5
A must listen podcast for anyone living in the GREAT USA!!!,03/04/2015,rapidsan,"Ok so here it goes my fist review...I been a loyal listener of Latino USA for a few years now.
With every podcast I learn and I meditate at the great source of information not only for Latinos but for all of us living in this ethnic blended society, it helps us understand and respect each other differences. My favorite part of the program is ""sabiduria"" a little clip of wisdom from a everyday person.We can learn so much just by listening to one another.My kids listen because I want them to understand the privilege it is to have been born in this country made by immigrants from all parts of the world.",5
Alimento para el alma,03/15/2015,Robycruizer,"Tanto para el expatriado, como para el patriota, Latino USA articula las aspiraciones y los retos de una comunidad tan diversa como sus Nacionalidades.",5
One Of The Best Podcasts Out There,03/15/2015,Boston Anthony,"This podcast is phenomenal! It's totally relevant and always intriguing! One thing that's clear, is that this podcast was designed for EVERYONE, not just Latinos. In fact, I'm not Latino and I can sincerely say that I absolutely love Latino USA!!!",5
Superb show,03/15/2015,YellowLizard,"Latino USA is extraordinarily well put together. I've been listening to it for years. They give voice to a diverse array of ordinary people that other journalists ignore. I always learn something new, and I'm always entertained.",5
Favorite long form journalism show,03/16/2015,ANGER FURY,best English language Latino affairs programming!,5
Favorite podcast of all,03/17/2015,HazanFamily,"Latino USA is a magnificent weekly podcast about Latino, social, and immigration issues. It is politically engaged, stimulating, and mind stretching. You do not need to be a Latino to enjoy it (I am an immigrant, but not a Latino). If you care about justice, inequalities, freedoms, opportunities, human rights, the spirit of survival, and joie de vivre, give it a try. Host Maria Hinojosa is remarkabky engaging. I look forward to it every week.",5
Latino Politics and culture 101,03/27/2015,DITALA cleaning services,"My 3 year old son runs around singing ""Latino USA Maria Hinojosa"" I love every topic picked in the shows keep up the amazing work!",5
Un Placer!,03/27/2015,cazepeda,Just great! They hit every topic I always think about. Only thing I wish they could do but also understand if they won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt is full spanish audio. Otherwise and anyways a great show.,5
Me encanta!,03/27/2015,Ervern!,Keep up the great work! I'm especially loving Antonia's stories.,5
Great show,03/23/2006,Gwalchgwynn,"I used to enjoy listening to Latino USA on KUT when I lived in Austin. Since I moved away four years ago, I have missed this program and I'm glad to have found it again via podcast. Latino USA is not just for Latinos. It is news from outside the mainstream, that is very professional and well done. I highly recommend it.",5
Can't get enough,06/03/2006,TaniaM,"This is by far one of, if not the best news sources that reports for the Latino population nationwide. Not only does it cover currrent issues in Latin America, but it speaks the truth about what is really happening in the U.S. within the Latino population. I love it and am a loyal listener. THANK YOU FOR THIS PODCAST",5
Latino USA: Required programming for Latinos in the U.S.,08/11/2006,Mardeniz,"Latino USA is required listening for any Latino that lives in the U.S. Its weekly programming includes a recap of political news throughout Latin America, some human interest stories and some relevant cultural tidbits relating to art, music, literature or even sports. The show's host, Maria Hinojosa-- whether she likes it or not--ends up being a gatekeeper of what constitutes news or simply interesting things for Latinos to know. It's a huge responsibility and one she doesn't shy way from.",5
A Fantastic Program,08/21/2007,kralmajales,"Respecfully, I couldn't disagree with Nevada Smith's review more. This program is politically balanced, well produced, and one of the best sources on Latino culture, art, and music. In today's rather vitriolic atmosphere of politics surrounding immigration, this show is a breath of fresh air. This gringo from West Virginia is learning a ton...it has broken down stereotypes that I find in the media all the time. If more people had an open mind and listened to this program, we might have better dialogues about the shifting culture of the United States.",5
Love this show!,10/09/2007,Salvadore√±a,More than just a news show it is a reflection of culture and all that comes with it! Highly recomended.,5
wonderful,01/05/2008,logiste,"This is definitely one of the best podcasts out there for Latinos, I enjoy each and every episode - keep them coming!",5
"Mr Julius Allen in Euless,TEXAS",03/31/2008,Julius in Euless Texas,"I have been listening to this program for over year now, I love the great programs, and features, I love how the show Maria's Hinojosa goes from spanish to english in a quick New York minute, I love her smooth crisp voice.",5
Hechale ganas!,06/04/2008,chicanodogsoldier,"This podcast is great; Maria Hinojosa is the consumate journalist, an example to her empty-headed propagandist peers on network ""news."" I don't really like, however, when the LUSA people combine two separate podcasts into one. I dunno, it's annoying. But continue your work!!",5
Necessary listening,07/27/2008,New Haven listener,Latino USA keeps me on top of important news stories that mainstream media do not cover. It deepens my knowledge about the diverse Latino community.,5
Amazing!!!,05/05/2019,1ito89,"Love it! I was hesitant at first no reason why but I‚Äôm Glad I gave it a chance, it‚Äôs amazing how much Latin/Hispanic influences are out there in USA history.",5
