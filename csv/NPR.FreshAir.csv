"Great show, but poorly edited as podcast",04/08/2007,NikitaSamuelle,"I was very excited to have access to Fresh Air as a podcast since I'm usually working when the show airs. The interviews are great, but the editing has been disappointing. Segment changes are choppy and episodes often end mid-sentence. The Ken Burns segment of March 15 was a particular disappointment, ending less than 10 minutes into the episode. I love the show! I just hope the editing improves.",3
Love fresh air! But tech problem with podcast,05/02/2019,Fancyfannie,"Fresh air is a 5 ‚Äî by far my favorite podcast.

Fresh air has become rancid,04/26/2019,stramosk,The liberal slant of Freah Air and other programs on PBS that did not seem to exist or was less blatant In the past forces me to unsubscribe and no longer support PBS. Time is too short and important to waste it on lies and distortion.,1
"Great show, but John Powers has got to go!",04/26/2019,Alambrito The first,"I‚Äôve been listening for years, and really, enjoy the show. That being said, the way John Powers‚Äô voice is so affected, it‚Äôs too distracting to pay attention to what he is saying.

No longer MY kinda show,02/27/2019,DeeDeeBear's account,"Fresh Air was my favorite show and I would schedule lunch around listening to it when my local public radio station aired it. I no longer listen due to Terry‚Äôs obsession with adding her views on politics to every discussion. I find her approach to the political subject matter off-putting and, in my opinion, her demeanor becomes pushy and self righteousness when she gets on this subject. I now listen to my shows in podcast format but I still browse the Fresh Air topics to see if there is something worth listening to that even Terry‚Äôs railing on republicans won‚Äôt ruin. I seldom chose to put myself through it and have found her ability to blame Republicans and Trump for everything a complete waste of my time. This is no longer ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù to me. Please change hosts and return to an ‚Äúall-purpose‚Äù format that isn‚Äôt full of a hosts personal agenda.",1
Fresh air and pop culture,03/02/2019,thorajean,"I‚Äôve been a long time listener and it seems that Fresh Air has shifted to covering more pop culture and Hollywood rather than the pressing issues which face our nation. Yes, there are many more outlets for political discussion and this may be the reason Fresh Air feels the need to cover vapid stories and individuals that, quite frankly, have nothing to do with our current state. Sad that Terry feels the need to swing towards pop.",1

Completely irritated,03/13/2019,Pwrstrk,"I love Fresh Air. I have been listening to it on the radio for years. I was really happy to be able to listen to it by podcast.

Review of Fresh Air program,03/20/2019,JoeBMac,"I used to be an avid listener and enjoyed the program, especially the variety of topics and guests.
But in the last several or more months it‚Äôs obvious there is a huge ‚Äúpolitical chip‚Äù on the shoulder of this program and its host. . Even topics and quests that should be considered neutral to politics are asked about political situations and the people involved. Always slanted.",2
Fresh Air,03/21/2019,banannamom,"I am an avid listener and I feel that Terri Gross is a genuine American Treasure. I really miss her when Dave Davies cavers for her, as his interviews are so dry. David Biencolli is a great sub, though. He is upbeat & his interviews are interesting. At any rebate ,the content and interviews are so good, that I listen to them on Podcasts to avoid missing a single show.",5
Biased,03/21/2019,Johnny Wells,"One sided, framing interviews and guests with a clear agenda in mind.",1
The podcast I forward most often,03/23/2019,BuffaloDad58,Terry and crew do a consistently excellent job in selecting topics/speakers and delivering insightful interviews.

Join in and spread the word.,5
Getting Stale,03/24/2019,Kenston42,"I listen to a lot of podcasts, and for years this was my favorite, along with This American Life. However recently I‚Äôve found myself deleting a Fresh Air podcast before it‚Äôs finished because I just get tired of the leading questions and the clear bias of Teri Gross. I would really like to hear her less and the people she‚Äôs interviewing more. Ask open-ended questions and let your guests respond without interruption.",2

Insightful Podcast on Schizophrenia,03/29/2019,Niobahna Bryan,"The podcast I watched was about a father who had 2 sons diagnosed with schizophrenia. It made me understand a bit more the struggles that someone with mentally ill familty members go throuhgh. The fact that it was a father instead of a scientist or psychologist made the podcast so real. It was interesting to watch, even my mom that was cooking was listenning in. This podcast was informaiton and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Abrasive, tone-deaf Terry",04/01/2019,LaStephe88,"Someone please sit this woman down and recalibrate her understanding of human conversation. While I can have an appreciation for edgy, confronting interviews, Terry is clumsy, lazy and downright rude with her interactions. Asks repeated out-of-touch and inane questions.",1
Great,04/14/2019,jb marie,As far as Terri being tone deaf and abrasive at least every other word that comes out of her mouth isn‚Äôt the f word To the person who wrote it stop being prejudice of older people. To the person who complained about the editing let me guess you‚Äôre an editor an out of a job one? I love this show.

Fresh Air,04/18/2019,Sweet francie,"Teri Gross is probably the best interviewer I have ever listened heard.
She has always read the book, heard the music, seen the art.She is never unprepared, unlike many interviewers I have heardAnd it is never about her‚Äîshe always remembers what she is there for. I have listened over the years as she has worked to make her voice more pleasing and learned how to ask questions that in other hands would seem intrusive, but she makes her interviewees want to answer.

"What is up with ""padooooother""",01/11/2019,Shadwell von Bernstein,"I am quite liberal in my outlook and voiting record, but I can easily understand how this show and others like it whip up dim witted working class whites to a level of rage and to vote against their own interests just to stick it to smug left wing insufferably PC elites. If you dont get it, you probably never will. However, beyond all this, there is one thing I simply can't stand. It is uterly ridiculous and unexplanable. Why the heck does Terry Gross pronounce ""producer"" like a toddler with a lisp as ""pa-doooo-ther""? Does she have a speech problem? Is there some kind of growth on her toungue? Since she occassionaly slips and pronounces it like a normal human (or 'yoo-man"" as she likes to say), I have to assume this is some kind of hipster left wing affectation.",1
Tired of Gross,01/12/2019,Raenick,"Terry Gross is often so busy trying to prove her knowledge, or lack of, that she steps on the guest. I listen to hear whet the guest has to say or their thoughts. Not gross trying to lead them to a thought, most guest are polite and comment how they never thought of it that way. Don‚Äôt listen to hear her thoughts on their lives, want to know their feelings and experiences. Her interview with Kevin Hart was the last straw, tried so hard to create controversy it was painful to listen to.",1
Best podcast out there,01/12/2019,Jaoto,"Fresh air is the best of the best. Teri Gross is insightful and interesting. She often asks her guests questions that make them say, ‚ÄúI never thought of it that way. You are right.‚Äù",5
Fresh air devolves into ‚Äúgotcha journalism‚Äù!,01/13/2019,martenas godfrey,"As someone who has listened to this show for over a decade, i have to say that it has to come down from its ivory tower.

Hurtful and cruel!!!! Shame!,07/26/2018,Land of Lincoln Listener,"What is wrong with you, Ms. Gross? I believe in ""live and let live"" and I draw the line at ridicule and intentional hurt. Don't you think that this country, with it's current state of leadership, is enduring enough cruelty? Why pour it on even thicker?

"Overall good, sometimes problematic",08/20/2018,deliciousbrie,"I generally enjoy Terry‚Äôs interviews but I found her interview of the author of crazy rich Asians to be problematic. From her questions, I thought she lacked understanding of the subject matter (Asians of all nationalities and the struggle for representation). I‚Äôve listened to tons of Terry‚Äôs interviews, usually good, but this one stood out because she seemed to have done no research prior to the interview. She was overly fixated on the topic of wealth and her approach to the discussion of Asian and Asian American struggles were superficial. Example: terry‚Äôs discussion of the plastic surgery phenomenon is presented as purely an Asian desire to look ‚Äúwestern‚Äù. The truth of the matter is, there are billions of Asians in the world and many of them do not look ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù based on western stereotypes. Walk around China and you will see Chinese people who do not look ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù as westerners expect, because the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù people isn‚Äôt a mono-ethnic group and there is a long history of various peoples getting assimilated into the Chinese population. Furthermore, do I even need to bring up the reality that many caucasians are using plastic surgery to look more ‚Äúexotic‚Äù or ‚Äúmultiracial‚Äù. The fake tans, the breast implants, butt implants, lip injections ‚Äî these augmented features are hardly the stereotypic physical features of caucasians. What I find problematic is that when Asians get plastic surgery, it‚Äôs presented as ‚ÄúAsians wanting to look western‚Äù but when caucasians get plastic surgery, it‚Äôs presented as ‚Äújust wanting to look more attractive‚Äù. This is quite a limited POV. Lastly, the topic of ‚Äúracial purity‚Äù (is the actor who played the male protagonist ‚ÄúAsian enough‚Äù) is exceptionally problematic. There is only one race, the human race. Go back enough generations and all of us are of ‚Äúmixed ancestries‚Äù. How many generations back do we have to trace to be considered ‚Äúracially pure‚Äù enough? President Obama is half Caucasian, but everybody refers to him as the ‚Äúfirst black president‚Äù. The trap that biracial or multiracial people find themselves falling into is that they‚Äôre always forced into one category or the other by society. In the case of multiracial Asian actors, they‚Äôre always labeled as too Asian to play white characters but also too white to play Asian characters. This is a very sad state of things.",2

(I secretly delight in it each time she lets out a snort while laughing.) However, the underlying political aspects of the show wear thin quickly. I tolerated episodes in recent years with pro-Obama slants‚Äî‚Äútolerated‚Äù not because I had issue with Obama but because I found Fresh Air‚Äôs adoration too cloying. But the frequency and ranting tone of anti-Trump stories is just too much. I don‚Äôt like Trump myself, but where I‚Äôd hoped to find refuge from the onslaught of biased media coverage and divisiveness in social media posts, in usually delightful and/or thought-provoking interviews, I find more of it. So I find myself skipping over more episodes than ever before, relieved to find the straightforward celebrity or author interviews that continue to satisfy.",3

I am sensitive to certain noises, and all the mouth noises, smacking, and saliva sloshing going on is so distracting and maddening I can't take it anymore! What's worse is it's usually between sentences and before and after words, so there's no competing noise, just saliva in my ear. There is basic audio filter or free mastering software to fix that. Can people back away from the mic or get a better pop filter or something?? I'm sure I'm probably the only person that cares, but I just can't. Love the content though!",4

Sometimes however, when an artist of one medium or other is being interviewed, there are questions I feel go unasked and/or unanswered that listeners want to know about that person. I suppose, when that happens it may be a matter of not having enough time to get those questions in. Just listened to an interview of Spike Lee, whose movies I find interesting and often funny. The interview was good but questions such as who his favorite director is or his favorite movie and why was missing. Again, perhaps just a matter of time. Otherwise, fresh air is fresh.",4

Terry Gross is a highly skilled interviewer who is easy to listen to and appears to put her guests at ease. I don‚Äôt understand why she tries to occasionally cover religious topics when she only invites atheists and never people of faith. If she is not comfortable with Christianity, it would make sense to not cover religion at all rather than present this perspective that is so out of the mainstream and unbalanced. I am not sure what the point is in those episodes but fortunately they are somewhat rare. Otherwise a great podcast and often highly educational.",4

Dripping with liberal bias,09/09/2017,EddiefromEugene,I'm a fan of interview shows but I rarely find the subjects of this show all that interesting. One huge turnoff is the consistent liberal bias in the show. Screams for there to be a second conservative host to balance it out,2

As with many things that I have come to cherish, I couldn't stand her at first. She and the show gradually grew on me and I have been a die hard fan for twenty years. Her guests vary wildly but she is equally probing and perceptive yet polite to everyone. I could go on an on but my device is acting up. Suffice it to say I recommend ""Fresh Air"" without reservation. Enjoy!",5
30 years,06/15/2017,di.Tunes,"Been a listener to this show since the beginning. Still the best audio program, ever! Terry Gross is the standard against which all others should be measured.

I say this as a deeply progressive person. Even when she has brilliant and fascinating people on who are more than capable of articulating a nuanced idea or opinion, the questions and conversations are decidedly low-brow. I understand this is a podcast for the masses, but I think we could handle a little bit more... the pop culture reviewers, however, are excellent, not because I agree with their opinions, but rather because of the quality of their wit and the depth and sensitivity of their aesthetic perspectives.",2

Maurice Sendak rightly granted her his final interview and praised her rightly for her intelligent questions. Our democracy is better off because of people like Terry. In the age of Trump, I find refuge of sanity and reason embodied by her work. Thank you, Terry, for saving us from our baser instincts and appealing to the better angels of ourselves.",5

It would be great to hear Best Of episodes culled from Fresh Air's vast archive of interviews, but I can't find a reason why I'd want to listen to the same interview twice in a week. Hate to be so picky, but it's a blemish on the show's otherwise flawless production. Is there a way to unsubscribe from those episodes alone?",3

Separate the extras,09/12/2016,AG 2,"This podcast used to separate the extras (music, tv, movie, etc. reviews) which was GREAT now I have to listen to them whether I want to or not before going to the next episode.

Re-activate the 15-second rewind button !!!,02/02/2016,snapper-Z,"Fresh Air has deactivated the fast forward and rewind buttons on Apple's podcast app so that, if u do not hear something properly and try to replay the past 30 seconds -- or, alternatively, rush through a portion that's upsetting, the entire podcast starts over from the beginning.

Love the Whole Episodes,01/30/2015,erichaynes,I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast (and radio show) for most of my life and was very disappointed when the podcast was split up into segments. I would have been ok with it if the segments played in order but that never happened and sometimes it depended on what downloaded or didn‚Äôt download and all that itunes/iphone non-sense.

Please just keep doing this.,5
please go back to the separate stories!,01/31/2015,laksjdhfg,"Fresh Air is one of the greatest shows ever, and part of that greatness is the huge variety of content. Which means that NO ONE is interested in every single thing you put out. Hell, even Terry Gross is obviously uninterested sometimes. So why did you go back to the all-in-one format that makes it extremely difficult to skip stories? You don't even tell us how long each one is, so we have to just scroll around trying to find the end of a story. I, for one, will be listening a lot less, just because it's a lot easier to just delete the whole episode than to deal with figuring it out. After all, if I wanted to hear the whole show every day, I could listen on the radio, or stream from the zillion radio stations and apps that offer it on demand!

The show used to have serious thinkers, journalists and artists on almost all the time. Now it‚Äôs show runners (whatever that is), comedians (sorry, Louis CK is not a serious thinker), celebrity screenwriters and the like. Does anyone really care what Mark Ronson‚Äôs life is like?

Downloading issues,10/27/2014,Julia_Rose_90,"I love the show, but recently I've had trouble downloading some of the episodes. They seem to have downloaded, but they'll only play the 10 second ad-intro, then make an awkward record-scratch sound, and then play silence. It's frustrating and sad: I've been listening to the podcast for 3 years and I love it, I wish it was working. Sometimes deleting and re-downloading works, but not always. Please fix this!!",5
Love the show - podcasts not so much,10/29/2014,SuckeredByItunes,"The editing for the podcasts of the show is terrible.

What's wrong with just having the whole show in one podcast like every other NPR show does?",1
Love the show...podcast is broken!,10/30/2014,ModernNest,For months now the intro commercials on every Fresh Air episode on iTunes consists of a 20 second commercial and 8 or 9 minutes of dead air. I can't fast forward through them. Needless to say I never get to the episode and end up needing to listen via the website. Please fix this so I can listen to a so that I so dearly love. Thanks.,3
Podcast does not download,11/24/2014,ArtemisArtemis,"For years, I downloaded Fresh Air. Now, only errors. Please fix!",1
Used to love the show...,12/08/2014,Smuckazz Eeets Treetz,"Fresh Air used to be a fantastic hodgepodge of everything from current events to science to the arts. Seems dominated by arts content now, so not as much interesting variation. One of the few segments I've heard lately on a non-arts topic was a big turnoff: in ""The Education of Mitch McConnell"" segment, Terry threw up exclusively softball questions that didn't challenge any of the guest's positions in the slightest. Pretty disappointing from the host who at one time was known for being easygoing but u afraid to challenge everyone from Bill O'Riley to Hillary Clinton. Too much good stuff available these days that actually probes the complexities of the issues... Sad to say I'm done with Fresh Air",2
What makes Terry Gross so good?,01/27/2015,Augiesasso,"I was hooked to listening to a Steve Martin interview years ago. I don't know what it was about the show, but Terry invites you in and seems to ask the questions you are thinking about and gets the interviewee to talk more deeply and more intensely about the topic than anywhere else. The long form format helps however, it takes skill to listen to a 45 minute interview from beginning to end and not get bored. And Terry does that every time.",5
Very insightful interviews,07/15/2013,SueKing500,Love this podcast,5
Great podcast,07/18/2013,CrabbyFry,This is a great podcast. It is a bit redundant to have the fresh air weekend included. I usually just skip over those since it is just a replay of an earlier story. Weekend should be its own podcast.,4

Terry needs a refresher course,08/16/2013,PVBarbara,"Terry Gross has always been a great interviewer because (a) she asks the questions you want to ask, (b) she asks the tough follow up questions when handed an intriguing lead by her guest and (c) she gets out of the way.",2

"Interesting topics. If it were actually audible, that might help",10/12/2013,Bermuder,"I download these podcasts occasionally if a topic comes up that I'm interested in. They're very interesting, in-depth interviews with experts on various topics or personalities in the entertainment industry. I find the quietness a bit annoying--other podcasts I subscribe to can be heard perfectly if played on full blast on my iPad; this one is just *too quiet.* I like listening to podcasts while doing the dishes or baking, and other podcasts can be heard over the din when played at full level; this one can't. I know that they deliberely speak in that ""soothing,"" hushed NPR tone, but I wish they would enhance the volume of this podcast so it can be clearly heard when played at full volume on an iPad. It's fine if I download it to my iPod instead and listen to it with headphones, but I prefer to just set my iPad down and play it from there, because I don't want to shut the whole world out (and have someone come home and startle me) and because the Podcasts app works fine within an iPad but crashes frequently on an iPod. I wish Terry would speak up rather than practically whisper, because her guests inevitably end up mirroring this barely-audible tone. But since that probably won't happen, please enhance the volume level of the podcast so it's actually audible.",3
Possible glitch??,10/19/2013,bob dole is already taken,Terry Gross is a fantasic journalist and I really enjoy listening to her and her guests but there's some glitch with the podcast.

what a great podcast,12/08/2013,OblongNoKnees,"This was the first podcast I started listening to. Now I am hooked on a bunch of different podcasts but this one still stays as one of my favorites. Terry Gross is a masterful interviewer and their is a plethora of guests relating to almost anything you can think of. I love this podcast and would reccomend it to anyone. Apparently, from looking at the comments below the episodes are cut down, so with uniformed outrage I say nay to that, but I wasn't aware that it was happening. Still 5/5 stars.",5

Format=I quit,12/06/2012,scooter927,"New format makes it impossible to know what you're about to get, and unlike switching on the radio and listening, you don't get the full show. Also, Ms. Gross is a good interviewer (w/the occasional exception, when she doesn't delve deep enough), but her speech impediment seems to have worsened, and she trips over more words than ever before. Can't this be addressed? Or, as with most NPR vocal and speech quirks, is this the sound of commercial-free radio, like it or lump it?",3
ATTN NPR STAFF: Editing problems,12/07/2012,Aultfilm,"There's no doubt that Fresh Air is a great show, but the way it's presented on iTunes is irksome.

very frustrated with this podcast,12/15/2012,mlynneo,"I ONLY want to hear the full interview shows. I do not want pieces edited for a compilation ""weekend"" show.

I used to listen to EVERY Fresh Air podcast and loved them and learned so much. Not anymore.",1
Hard To Rave,12/29/2012,trevianace,"Terry Gross is apparently an acquired taste that I haven't acquired. She is not terribly insightful nor effective as an interviewer and often is corrected by her guests. That is probably at least a comment on her producers as well as her but the bottom line is her guest take Terry where they want to go as opposed to the other way around. What is really wrong with this podcast, however, is how it isa edited.. Others have written at length here about this but why the segments are chopped up as they are is maddening.I'm trying to like this podcast, but its becoming more trying, than like.",2

I love Fresh Air!,01/05/2013,Hong Kong Kathy,I have loved and listened to this show for years - on the radio and podcast. It has helped living now in Hong Kong to keep up with it.

uninformed,02/05/2013,ironagecustom,"i've been listening to fresh air for at least 12 years, the last 7 or so on ipod. it seems that it is a shill for whoever will come on the show. maybe it has to do with their finacial situation. conservatives get tossed softballs, liberals get all the time they need to spread their lies. it is apparent the host is a ""spiritual"" atheist who skews everything to the left and asks questions from pure ignorance. any show that contains information i know something about has tons of factual errors. it just seems to be getting worse over time.",3
Terrific,02/15/2013,Morah_B,I love getting Fresh Air as a podcast. Nearly every single interview is very interesting and now I don't miss a single one. I listen to this on my commute and it makes the day so much better.,5
Terry I love you,03/01/2013,KRaeA,"Great interviews. Great show. The way it is posted to itunes isn't the most useful- I recommend listening through an app like downcast, which automatically downloads them, otherwise sorting through all the spliced shows can get a bit tiresome.",4
Stale and boring,03/27/2013,Buddy Y,This show has gotten so boring and predictable! Compare this show to Freakonomics and you can really see the disparity. Is Teri Gross even awake?,1
I love Fresh Air just not the podcasts,04/04/2013,megan528,I love Fresh Air but I've recently noticed a change in how the podcasts get put up and there are in bits and pieces now with massive amounts of repeated segments.

New format ruins the podcast,07/01/2012,JCSBJ,"I have been a faithful listener of Fresh Air for years and feel like the day is not complete without my dose of Terry Gross and Fresh Air. I learn so much about current events that is not covered elsewhere and Terry Gross is the best interviewer ever!! I have heard about people that are not familiar to me and come away feeling like I really know them. The new format of chopping things up and cutting things out ruins the whole show, there is no continuity and I feel like I miss my whole ""fix"". Most of the time I just fast-forward through and don't even bother to listen. Please, please bring the entire show back!!!!!!!",2

They used to podcast entire episodes, now it's mostly just short segments of the show. I can't listen to the show live so the podcast was a great way to keep up.

ANOTHER person upset with the new packaging of segments,07/16/2012,Funn007,"I hope someone is listening! We don't like the ""re-packaging""!

Show: great; format: not so great,07/19/2012,Canavansbackyard,"This show routinely features excellent content. I've enjoyed both the interviews and the reviews for many a year the show remains one of my favorites from NPR. But I'm afraid I find myself on the side of those who dislike the recent decision to segment the podcast; it ruins the continuity and the listening experience. If, for whatever reason, the producers feel that they must continue this abominable practice, can they not also make a single, unitary daily episode available for download?",4
Anyway you listen... it's still great,07/22/2012,Lucho Blanco,"In pieces, in chunks, a segment here, a segment there... who cares!!! FA's still the best NPR has to offer -besides ATC and CarTalk and WWDTM of course!",5
Should be required listening for all,07/24/2012,patpras,Topics are timely and delivered from all angles so that you have a strong sense of understanding an issue. This show informs me in ways very few other programs do.,5
Like the new format,07/24/2012,Yorkshire exile,Goes without saying that the show is excellent. Several times a week I reference something that I heard on Fresh Air. The new format is a big improvement. If I have heard a segment earlier or am not interested in one then can just skip to the end without missing the shorter segment at the end of the program.,5
Here The Thing with Alec Baldwin,07/29/2012,Oraine from N.Y.,My cousin from Toronto just turned me onto Here's the Thing. As soon as I heard Alec Baldwin's voice I was hooked. It's a great venue for this very charismatic man. I like the way he is able to speak to a wide variety of guests as though he is intimately familiar with each of them.. He allows you to get to know the interviewees. Very entertaining podcast.,5
Great Podcast,08/01/2012,Mac B from Tennessee,"I've come around to the way the podcast is edited by segment now. It just took some getting used to. I like that if I have a backlog, I can remove segments I've heard or have no interest in.",5
Terry is better than Oprah,08/10/2012,DDKKs,Terry does a better interview than anyone. She manages to ask hard questions in a respectful way that requires the subject to give a real answer and not spin it.,5
Too little Terry,08/16/2012,Listener from Brooklyn,"I live Fresh Air for one reason: Terry Gross. I have absolutely no interest in listening when Terry's absent and that has been far too often recently. I understand that Terry has been doing this for a long time and that 5 days a week must be a rough haul, but her guest hosts do nothing for me. I've stopped checking for and downloading new content most days because more often than not lately I'll get a show with a guest host. I'm about to give up on the show entirely.",2

"It's good, but the podcast in iTunes is becoming nearly unusable.",09/12/2012,Srotenberg,"I used to love Fresh Air podcasts, guaranteed interesting hour or so. Then they started splitting the podcast up into tiny increments so you had to go through the sign on/off 6 times to listen to one podcast and still hear the ""on air"" station identification stuff.

I can see the reasoning behind doing it this way, but it feels a little disjointed if you wish you were listening to the regular show format. If you want to listen to it that way, then go to the NPR website and listen to it under the ""Programs"" tab. The player will play the show without station identification in the order and pausing that God intended. Great content.",4

If your podcast settings are ""download most recent"" then you'll end up with only one part of each night's show (easily fixed, but has to be done at home). Then I never know which segment goes first. Part of the magic of the show is that I found myself listening to people that I didn't think I was interested in over the course of a show.

The new practice of splitting up the broadcast into smaller podcast episodes is a failure. It foils the automatic update and splinters the continuity of the show. And the editing??

Great Podcast. New format is BAD,04/13/2012,Haleynaebig,"Love this podcast. All the players on it are terrific. But the idea of splitting it into pieces doesn't work for me. I like the whole thing, and find myself downloading it much less frequently as a result.",4

"I love Fresh Air, new format is terrible",04/26/2012,Gr3gorsamsa,I've been listening to Fresh Air for over 10 years and the podcast for about 4 years and it is wonderful. Since the new podcast format has been released I have only listened to a couple of episodes in the past month. It is too choppy and complicated. I would much prefer that the podcast be returned to its original unedited format.,4

"Love the show, but please put it back together!",04/27/2012,BFG 76,"This would be a five star rating for the show alone. I have loved Fresh Air for many years.

I came back, and I can't download the Fresh Air episodes that I missed this week, nor can I get full episodes. This is so disappointing. I was planning to catch up on this week's episodes on my drive back to school tomorrow. Please start posting full episodes again. I understand that NPR is on a budget, but the appropriate thing to do would have been to let podcast listeners know in advance that this was going to happen if it is absolutely necessary.

NPR dropped the ball,03/12/2012,berklyn,"It's a ""dead parrot"" now that they stopped posting the interviews which was always the best part. My workaround is to go to their website and download it into iTunes and change it from music to podcast in the options menu. I don't know why they can't just post it on iTunes like they do on their website. That's the only reason I give it a one star. Maybe if everyone does this they'll get the message. It is a great podcast otherwise.",1

What going on?,03/10/2012,terrryguy,Who made the (very) bad decision to reduce the Fresh Air podcast to a shell of its former self? Is this part of a larger plan to force the public radio listening audience to pay TWICE for content? It's a terrible idea and will only serve to alienate Terry's core audience. Join me in writing to WHYY to ask them to post the complete podcast and to put up more episodes.,1
What the hell is wrong with you people?,03/10/2012,Mr Jumpy Jump,The old format was great. I've listened to just about every episode on iTunes since I started downloading podcasts 4 or 5 years ago. This change is awful. Please bring back the old format.,1

Review writing,02/29/2012,Fromthedarkwater,"Rating a podcast on its lack of titles is trivial and shows a real deficiency in the reviewers mental capacity. A review should be of the content, not the user experience. This podcast deserves more than to have impatient ""iTouch"" users run rampant with their star ratings. Anyone who uses the term ""iTouch"" to refer to their ""iPod touch"" shouldn't be aloud to speak let alone make ratings.",1

How come only one episode!?,03/08/2012,Demi Moaned,What happened to Fresh Air? They used to have the ten most recent episodes available in the Apple Store. This was convenient as you only need to log in once every two weeks in order to stay current.,5
Fresh Air,03/08/2012,KWS111,"I agree! Where have all the recent episodes gone? Please find a way to revert to the old system of the last ten episodes, with their descriptions. This is frustrating and annoying. Past episodes were always 5 star; new system gets NO STARS!",5

Fix to downloading problem,03/09/2012,FridayFixer,"Bravo to Fresh Air for splitting each show's stories into individual podcasts. To get around the current problem of new shows not appearing, resubscribe to the podcast. It's not perfect, but it's a good temporary solution.",5
What happened to full episodes?,03/09/2012,Teacup97828,"I've subscribed to this program for quite a while, but it looks like they've gone to podcasts that just have a part of the day's program. What's up? No more full episodes? Disappointing doesn't start to express my feelings.",2

Where did all the podcasts go?,03/09/2012,Missing Access,"Hello! I am a member of KCFR in Colorado. I must admit to being a bit of a radiophile; I especially love Fresh Air. As a stay at home mom, I look forward to the conversations that grace your show. Unfortunately, I cannot always catch the radio broadcast. It plays in our area when I am picking up my 5 year old from preschool. I often would find a day so packed with block stacking, and baths and painting that I would miss the day's podcast entirely. I loved that you would allow us to go back and listen to shows further back than just the previous show. No worries, I could always catch the podcast.Until now. When I visited your iTunes site I found only a 6 minute excerpt. I don't know that i will waste my time downloading a portion of the show (especially if those portions consist of monologues). Thank you for all you have done, I will genuinely miss Fresh Air and the hour of witty banter in brought to my day.",5

Excellent Podcast!,11/16/2011,CjoyLaBelle,"I can't believe you people are rating Terry Gross & Fresh Air low because you don't know how to use technology. Don't hit the title, hit the ""FREE"" button next to it to download it to your phone. And if you are going to be so picky as to what the subject matter is before hand, might I suggest visiting their website. You know this show, while sometimes the subject could sound a little less than exciting, I find that Terry and her crew research and ask thought provoking questions that not only make the subject matter fascinating, but also I usually walk away a little more enlighten. I'm very thankful that I don't snub the shows based on the title and I give each show a chance. Life is sometimes a grab bag, so relax, give it a try... you might just learn something new. And for crumb sake learn how to use your devices. I'm over 50 and I figured it out! Maybe it's because I remain open to new things. Hum",5

Wonderful show,11/18/2011,Lunics,Terri is an amazing interviewer. She also clearly has an amazing support staff and a great go-to host Dave. Thanks for all the fascinating and probing interviews.,5
NPR at it's worst,11/25/2011,cvplummer,"I have always hated this show.. I don't know if it's the over-intellectualization of the host (the kind that would have her actually say that Gene Simmon's behavior is an 'act' right to his face, of which she could not handle the blow-back) or the utterly horrible taste the music reviewer has. Between the mind numbing haute interviews and music reviews trying so hard to convince me of the artistic honesty of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry, and countless obscure acts I feel like my mind us numb from the mental hand job.. So much so I have to rake a nap.",2
Boring!,11/25/2011,AJTJR,Fresh Air is stale. So left leaning it is boring and predictable.,2
"Great show, but the sound levels need work",12/05/2011,Akibo1,"Fresh Air is my favorite podcast on NPR. My only complaint is that the sound levels between Terry Gross and her interviewee are often way off, so I need to adjust the volume depending on who is talking. I hope they spend a little time adjusting levels before putting out the podcast. Other than that, great work!",5
The best interviewer working today,12/28/2011,Mezadourian,"Terry Gross has a great combination of intelligence and charm. She asks question from a place of curiosity, creating space for her guests to offer insightful answers. And she stood up to Uta Hagen - and won.",5
Great Podcast,01/04/2012,j276,"One of the few I listen to frequently. I would give 5 stars if they would change the book reviewer...Her opinions are fine, but the nasal voice and extreme enunciation makes me want to scratch out my eyes.",4
Cure for common commute,01/13/2012,Superjuliebelle,"This is a stellar show. Fascinating interviews and thoughtful reviews. It keeps me company on my way to work, and the commute flies by!

Disgusted by Apple's greed,08/24/2011,Worddancer,Hundreds of dollars for an iPod touch in March. Put up that ridiculous amount of money for this proprietary device so that I could easily have access to podcasts. Now Apple won't let people download them on iPods? Last Apple device I ever buy.,1

The Best,11/21/2010,EgbertSouse,"T Gross is, simply put, the best interviewer working in the media, and probably the most responsible one too. I listen to many radio shows and podcasts weekly, and it's noteworthy that she and her show are referenced more often than any other.",5

The worst voice on Radio,12/27/2010,mr. suggestion,"As a podcast creator (DogSoup) I listen with a 'different' ear. I want to know what makes a podcast or radio show like RadioLab or this american life work. I stumbled upon fresh air and found the ultimate, yet, ahhh,...predictible path. editing. Yeah, really thats what it is all about. Knowing when to move to the next sensory perception before the yawning starts. Active brains need to learn. this is key for all you podcasters- don't stall- you don't need a special guest like George Clooney- just keep our brains moving, guessing- yeah- thinking. in 3 years the internet will be flooded by good podcasts- this will no longer be special, sadly. But is that a bad thing? If someone smarter than Einstein lived would that be bad? NO. The digital age is good. It allows even the least and minor of us to reach public acclaim. That is a good thing. Sincerely, DogSoup.",4
Terry and Rappers,12/30/2010,Woopitywooper,"Usually love Terry's interviews as she's one if the best in the business. but Please don't let her interview another rapper. Leave that to Dave or others on the show, as Terry sounds ridiculous and out of her element and obviously not informed on the subject. Each time she says ""hip hop""'or ""rhyme"" I cringed.",5
Usually great topics,01/01/2011,teacher.S,"Terry Gross is a fantastic interviewer, and the people she interviews are always interesting. I am always hooked even though I don't think I really care about the individual being interviewed. This is with only one exception... Jay-Z. The interview was dull, maybe it was Jay-Z who is dull. I listened for a few minutes until they played his music, then I HAD to turn off the garbage. I am completely not interested in rap music, but I am also not interested in many other people Terry interviews and I end up hooked. I think rap artists and NPR listeners do not mesh well. The NPR demographics do not support rap or the rap lifestyle, so the fact that Jay-Z was interviewed at all confuses me. Other than that horrible interview, the rest of the shows are great. I will not stop listening because of this one error in judgement.",5
podcast download information lacking titles and content,02/20/2011,foto27,"Great show ---- GREAT SHOW!
But, when I download the podcast all that appears on the title listing is the date. The subject(s) of the show is not available, so it is impossible to know what is being discussed once downloaded. Nothing appears in the description column either. When downloading several shows at one time, this makes it extremely difficult to keep track of the content. Why can't the information be put there instead of the date, which appears anyway next to the title column. Most all other podcasts do this routinely. DUHHHHHHHHH!",2

Another Lecture on Liberal Politics,03/28/2010,Simple Music Fan,"I occasionally find Fresh Air illuminating, sometimes interesting. What I find most often is a show from a very specific political viewpoint that is decidedly favorable toward what is happening in Washington today. What I would like to see is something more insightful and balanced. Why not analyze what is disguised as healthcare reform and how the Constitution is impacted by it. Why isn't anything being said about the government's quick assumption of control over more than 50% of the economy in the period of a year? Why isn't there discussion of the open disdain and even contempt of any view that differs from what is now becoming the unholy trinity of the executive and legislative branches? Why isn't there discussion of how the current occupant of the White House is using the House and Senate as his personal lackies? Chicago politics have moved just a short geographical distance, but have taken a huge political jump. We are not the free country we were just a year ago, and no one is calling anyone on it. Just like the media kissed up to the occupier rather than asking him tough questions. Shame on the failure of all media.",2

Really great,04/07/2010,Rimeland,"Fresh air is a really excellent podcast when you want to listen to something quality that's not bogged down with too much personal/political opinion. Gross covers a really wide range of topics; her interviewees include authors, musicians, actors, politicians, reporters, etc. There is usually 2 or 3 parts per show so you get a good lump of interesting information within each 45 minutes. There is a new show pretty much every business day. I usually listen to it while cooking or cleaning. It's a great podcast choice!!!",5
10 previous interviews are NOT enough,04/11/2010,Choco Moose,I am disappointed that so few episodes are shown as available. Why only the 10 most recent? The one I wanted from March 10th is not shown.

"The genius of ""Fresh Air"" . . .",05/18/2010,Rico Boothman,"Yes, I agree with the major criticism--namely, that the editing is choppy and sometimes boneheaded. But much can be forgiven. Fresh Air is the best program of its kind, and it's wonderful that it's available as a podcast, as few of us are able to synchronize our schedules with the broadcasts. Unlike competitors like On Point, it doesn't showcase the usual suspects (does anyone really want or need another interview with Evan Thomas?).",4
Please make show contents viewable on iPod,06/03/2010,eroomc,"It's impossible to see the contents of each show when scrolling through an iPod / iPhone. This is frustrating and leads to not adding Fresh Air to my on the go playlist. Thus, most shows are skipped.",2

Authentic and entertaining without predjudice a plus. Lately fresh air has picked up same subject matter as many other NPR shows. This is dissapointing.",4
review for 12-11-09 podcast,12/14/2009,JKF_alone,"Normally I enjoy Fresh Air, even when I disagree with the point of view. In this episode, we have a reading from an exceedingly graphic rape novel, discussion of Hitler's favorite singer, and Thomas Hoving talking about his time at the Met. The first segment is stomach wrenching for anyone with an ounce of compassion, the middle dull, and the last segment (Mr. Hoving's) is infuriating. If he was a politician or CEO, his actions would have been cause for imprisonment. He is proud that he devalued a painting he purchased by starting a dis- information campaign. in politics it would be called slander, in business it would be an unethical practice, but as an Art Director, it's clever and something to advertise. He is also proud of selling items of real value, and purchasing items of questionable, transient value. In the host's famous interview with Gene Simmons from Kiss, he is taken to taken to task for his behavior, and persona. Mr. Hoving, on the other hand, is allowed to crow on his soapbox about how wonderful he is, and use public radio to attack his enemies. A few suggestions;",1

Had to acquire a taste for Gross,01/01/2010,steebes2002,"Took me a few months, but now can listen to Terry's interviews without gagging too much over liberal chunks. Also don't particularly like her NPR-style of directing interview subjects to answers with leading questions, or her use of questions with simple yes/no answer options. She relies heavily on the question-inflected statement to achieve the answer she seeks. That said, I get do a kick out of her interviews with arts/entertainment personalities, and avoid her political interviews.",3

Three years after Nikita...,03/13/2010,BillLarsen,"GREAT CONTENT, of course, but Nikita's review from April '07 still holds true. Poorly edited show. Typical programs consist of 2 parts. If early in the first part I decide that I want to tab forward to the beginning of the second part, it cannot be done. Tab takes me to the end of the entire program. My only option for finding the second part is to hold down the fast forward button and listen for voice changes. As elegant as an ancient 60's tape recorder. Terry, I know you operate on a shoestring budget, but why not task an intern to Google the solution to this one?",4
Smug but Good,03/14/2010,SpyThumb,"The opera is well done but not for everyone. Fine dining, expensive clothing, and smothering privilege ooze from Gross's talent purse. NPR is the attraction and Gross is lucky to reap residual acclaim. I'm annoyed how much I like her and this show. Its hard to ignore her failing attempt at cool and unaffected. Every word is nuanced with an undertoned sense of what's the word...elitism. Its a shame really. Only those few who can stomach the opera actually support it.

Frustrating,03/20/2010,??>><<MMNJNBVC,"As others note the podcast is badly produced, with no title or keyword information and no segmenting. In addition the content is over-edited; the originating station WHYY reruns some shows four times in one week and if you can stand listening to it repeatedly you'll find they are all slightly different. A word here or there, a sentence clipped. It doesn't make me comfortable when she claims to be documenting important cultural figures to feel the talk is so worked over.",3
Interesting so long as politics are not discussed,07/06/2009,Justdoingmything1,"There is no attempt to view and report political stories with anobjective point of view. To think that Ms Gross is an actual reporter is an exercise in naivity. Just listen to the blatant lovefest of Sandra Sotomeyor in the June 30th show.

Good Podcast,07/10/2009,Neka87,"This podcast is both intellecutally stimulating while remaining diverse and intruiging (which can sometimes be too hard to find). I love Terry (the usual host) because of her relevant questions and the level of comfort she provides for those being interviewed.

OK podcast,11/07/2008,Troutdaletim,I have listened to the show a long time and find the political side to be unworthy of the broadcast for the political partisanship shown.

Gross is Insufferable,01/08/2009,Explodius Harris,"What's a nine-letter synonym for ""emetic""? Try ""Teri Gross."" I've never seen such a half-hearted effort at conceiling one's views. Gross is as smug and slanted as they come, and she seems to think her act comes off as objective. She absolutely drives me up the wall...and I'm a liberal! Gross can't hold a candle to other NPR moderator/hosts like Tom Ashbrook or Diane Rehm. She almost always champions the view I hold, but unlike most people writing reviews here apparently, I'm not going to act like somebody's the world's greatest just because I agree with her. That's sort of different from being good--or responsible--at her job. (Ironically, that's the same reason why people will rate this review as ""not helpful"": not because it isn't helpful--seriously, what is or isn't helpful about a 200-word comment on a podcast?--but because it doesn't mesh with their prejudices.)",1

He thinks in rational and realistic terms while promoting equality and freedom. The founding fathers would have loved him (and would likely wonder how we got so off track in America). Its about ""we"" not ""me"" in this country and Bill understands that. In this sense, how is it Bill understands Jesus' preachings more than the right-wing so-called Christians? He's not even religious! Oh, because it's common sense, common decency which the far right has proven to be lacking. Anyway, the podcast does need some work in terms of editing. It takes forever to download this podcast compared to all my others and it can cut short at times, which is frustrating, but still well worth the content.

Warning! There's nothing worse than a great thing cut short!,04/03/2008,Nikuman,Usually a Fresh Air Podcast is between 30~60 minutes long most averaging over 50 minutes. Recently there have been some podcasts (like the one about the Bin Laden family) that were only 5 minutes or 7 minutes long. Be forewarned if you see unusually short ones like that -there is some technical glitch that has caused these podcasts to be cut short stopping mid-sentence just when they were getting interesting! Like coitus interruptus you'll wish you hadn't started in the first place!,5
A Fix for the Show Ending Early,04/04/2008,RandomConsumer,"To those how are having problems with downloading the podcast and are only getting partial shows, this is not intentional. NPR has been having a few problems of late with it's podcasts. I've had multiple shows give me problems. All Songs Considered, Fresh Air and Car Talk all seem to suffer this fate. On All Songs Considered they explained that if you're having trouble with the feed simply unsubscribe from the feed and resubscribe. This should solve your problems. Hope this helps.",4
"great show, but now only first 5 minutes",04/04/2008,rex67,"Not sure if this is a mistake, but since last week only 5-6 minutes of the program is available on the podcast.",3
10-year-nap,04/04/2008,reedwriter,There seems to be a major problem with the editing and production. I've downloaded this one several times as well as the bin laden episode and they cut off after 10 minutes...,1
fresh air,04/05/2008,Michele H,"I used to love listening to this podcast, but just recently they have decided to edit it dramatically. The podcast has gone from being 45 minutes long to only about 6 or 7 minutes. Very disappointing!",1
FResh AIR,04/05/2008,QVM,Great Half -a-podcast now! What do we have to now pay for the full versions of this podcast or what?,3
I love Fresh Air!,04/12/2008,cstephens314,"Fresh Air is great, I was so happy when I heard it was coming to iTunes.",5
Why the music is not included in many of the interviews!,04/14/2008,Sam Seegs,"Hey everyone,
The reason they can't include the songs in some podcasts is because people would be able to edit the podcast to take out the interviews and get the music for free. This creates licensing problems. When it's live on the radio, they have the rights to broadcast it, but if they play pre-recorded tunes, they record companies aren't happy. Hope this explains why iTunes and NPR aren't trying to short-change you; their hands are tied!",4
New Podcast staff?,04/16/2008,WalterHeape,"Fresh Air is one of my favorite NPR programs and Terry Gross one of my favorite radio personalities. I've subscribed to the podcast for over a year now. It started out very professional and well edited. Over the last few months the quality of the podcast has gone downhill (makes me wonder if there have been some cuts at NPR?). Gone is the pleasant NPR outro jingle. Now we have choppy editing and shows often cut off mid-run. Songs are edited out. Today's podcast, an interview with Uma Thurman, cuts off at the 1:17 mark (I've downloaded it 3 times so it's not me...). These inconsistencies are troubling when you consider this is one of the best shows on radio. NPR get it together!!",5
narrow and one-sided,04/19/2008,california robert,mostly bashing the right and promoting the left. very leftist mentality. fresh air should be balanced with some real programming for a well-rounded diet. occassionally there is something that is a little more than idealogical on fresh air. but only rarely. two stars.,2
Too white to be this important in this day and age.,04/24/2008,Diepiriye,"I used to love this show. This show tacitly offers a white perspective on subjects and rarely centralizes any others voices save for tokenizing 'the other'. While the show is informative and fresh, after listening to News and Notes or Tell Me More, I find that Fresh Air falls way short of critical insight.",2
Fresh Air now podcasted!,05/15/2008,sdlistener,"Seems like I waited forever for this one to appear. My only beef, and it's minor, is when they cut to a break and Terry says ""We're talking to Mr. X, who's currently...we're going to pause for a break."" On the normal radio broadcast a commercial or a musical interlude would come next. But on the podcast, what comes next is ""Welcome back, we're talking to..."" So, just a bit of editing is needed. Not a big deal.",4
"Good and all, but...",06/02/2008,violinist22,"I used to download this podcast regularly. Then I came across some trouble, the podcasts would just stop right in the middle. I wasn't happy about this. I tried everything. I even wrote to NPR about this problem, but they haven't responded at all. I gave up and stopped listening to it. Not worth it, in my opinion...",2
use an engineer,07/16/2008,DinnisTheMenace,I was glad to see another reviewer mention the uneven audio quality on Fresh Air's podcasts. They frequently switch around from Terry in present day recording to Terry in a past interview. These and also the introductions and interviews are often up and down in volume and also edited poorly. I sent a similar complaint to the Philadelphia radio station which hosts the show but they had no reply. I can't complain about the price I pay and I love this show. Just wish they would pay attention to that vanishing idea of quality.,4
this is usually a good show...,07/16/2008,whydoweneednicknames,"but i disagree that terry gross is the best interviewer. For more personal/human interest stories, I think she is fine. But, for the political shows, I much prefer Dave Davies. I think he has a better style that fits the political/social issue interviews. I don't feel that he leads the subject as much. For my tastes, Mrs. Gross is a little one-sided and somtimes seems a little unsure of her self (uncomfortable laughter). Please don't misunderstand. I appreciate and admire her abilities to front such a long-lasting, interesting show. Another point, I also don't like the current book reviewer. She sounds like she's trying to write an essay that's more important than the books she is reviewing. I always skip that part of the show (one of the great features of the podcast).",4
Cut short only 5 minutes into it!,08/23/2008,JPvr,I was so excited when I heard the beginning laugh from the 8/01/08 Fresh Air podcast! I recognized the opening scene of Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog. I had just purchased it on itunes and couldn't wait to hear the behind the scenes scoop of a great mini-musical. I don't even know if the interview went 5 minutes before it cut off. I thought that maybe my itunes had screwed up somehow but after looking at some of the reviews I'm seeing that this type of thing seems to be common with this show. If the podcast was posted in it's woefully short form (as opposed to some mistake on my part) PLEASE repost the full interview!,3
"Would have gotten the 5 stars, but the editing can be choppy(at times)",09/15/2008,FUnnefella,"I really enjoy this show every day. Its mix of culture, entertainment and politics are a joy.",4
"Eclectic mix of topics, Terry Gross is one of the best interviewers out there",09/15/2008,Penobscot,"When Terry Gross does an interview, you can tell that she has done her research. The topics cover everything from movies, CDs, TV shows and books to politics, pop culture and world figures.The political guests and authors cover everything from the left to the right of the political spectrum and Terry Gross does a better job than any other interviewer I have seen or heard of asking thoughtful and well researched questions to all of them. I have often learned of books, CDs, movies or TV shows that I never would have watched if I had not listened to this show. In addition to Terry's skills as an interviewer, the show brings in some of the best movie and music critics to round out the last 10-15 minutes of each show. I rarely miss an episode.",5
Awesome,07/13/2007,EricRyan,Great show...I'm a first time listener. Kudos to ITunes for bringing this forward and NPR ultimately for the great interviews and perspectives.,5
Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie 5/17/07 Acoustic Concert A+++,08/07/2007,Backdoor LaLa,"GREAT PODCAST and it's FREE. His voice is clear as a bell which I happen to really like about him. It's like having another album, but much more personal.",5
Interviews with Imagination,08/25/2007,CpLong,"I have always admired the way Terry Gross is able to imagine her way into the life of each person she interviews. She not only asks the questions I want most to hear, but she also always finds a way to ask that provocative, incisive question that allows the truth of the person to be heard.",5
Gene Simmons episode 8/31,09/06/2007,iDzine,"I love Fresh Air, first of all. But, I would like a warning to be attached to the 8/31 episode which features Gene Simmons from Kiss. He was very offensive with the host, rather disgustingly so. While I understand the idea of no censorship, I would have liked to be warned about his attitude toward women and sex-crude and unnecessary. My day would have been much better and my opinion of KISS untainted had I not listened.",3
Must listen daily,09/09/2007,kittenwhisperer,"Fresh Air and Radio Times from WHYY are programs I take time everyday to enjoy. They inform, entertain, and brroaden my world.",5
"Sometimes excellent, sometimes bias a-go-go",09/18/2007,Shmule Shekelberg III,"Terry Gross is a skilled interviewer. She's learned, and as I once heard her described ""could interview a slug and make it interesting"". After G.W. Bush took office she went, as NPR in general and shows such as Frontline on PBS did, on a liberal crusade. If you're a liberal it will be reassuring listening, but for Libertarians and middle of the roaders you will find many of the last 6 years of interviews to be quite biased whenever the guest is of a political bent. It's tiring, and doesn't suit her style. She's at her best when interviewing musicians, actors, writers, etc. Perhaps if a democrat is elected in 2008 she and NPR will relax and get back to what they do best. I hope so. My tax dollars are paying for it.",3
FINALLY...,10/06/2007,arturo41,"Terry Gross is a supurb interviewer; she's a good listener; her selection of topics, songs, etc. is good, though a bit much sometimes on music for me, an early bab boomer. This venue should give her an even broader audience which is great for everyone",4
OUTSTANDING NPR & ITUNES!,10/19/2007,thescribe,"I hadn't paid much attention to the podcasts. But, at the urging of my son, I decided to listen to a few and subscribe to some in kind. I've always enjoyed Fresh Air. The show's variety of guests and topics is unlike anything else you'll find on radio, television or the internet. I listen to NPR most of the day while driving or doing chores around the house. Now I can catch some portions of the show I might have missed on any given day. It's great.",5
Stephen Colbert on NPR,10/20/2007,resilient_spirit,"There's knowing, and then there is KNOWING. I always knew that the character Stephen Colbert presents on The Colbert Report is exactly that, a character or more accurrately, a persona. This NPR interview is the first time I've ever heard him out of character, and he's wonderful. He even stayed in character in front of President Bush (and roasted him good), and I think possibly NPR is the only place where he could drop the persona an simply be himself. I have enjoyed this glimpse inside the character, and the opportunity to get to know the man who brings that persona into our homes. I highly recommend this download to all Colbert fans.",5
Terry Gross is my hero!,11/01/2007,aztodd,Her interviewing style is unmatched. I am addicted to Fresh Air!,5
"Stale, and Stagnate",11/20/2007,ZXCQWEASD,"The stories are very well researched and informed, but they are far to long and dour, and eventually become mind-crushingly dull. The show manages to take subjects that should have you on the tip of your seat so profusely boring it's frankly horrifying. The reports should be trimmed down by half, then injected with perhaps the slightest bit of humor, WOULD IT KILL YOU TO DO THAT, and presented by far younger and more intesesting people. There are far better podcasts out there, please do not waste your time and disk space with this useless show that reeks of mothballs. I enjoy ""This American Life,"" as it manages to do something Ms. Gross seems amazingly opposed to, blending good reporting with entertainment. Truly stale and uninspiring.",1
inflection,12/01/2007,eclectikat,"I think one of the best aspects of this podcast is hearing parts of poems, literature read outloud by the authors. When you hear the inflection in their voice, pauses and breaks in sentences, it makes it incredibly insightful behind the meaning of the words. I have listened to the one of the poet sekou sundiata several times as well as interviews with philip roth. excellent.",5
Wonderful scoops,01/06/2008,navinsharma@yahoocom,"Terri Gross's capturing of current topics and insightful guests is a combination worth ingesting daily! The interview of David Johnston, author of ""Free Lunch"", was extremely well conducted. There is always room on my iPod for Terry's show....",5
Another must have podcast,01/06/2008,russellfrost,"Easily in the top five shows broadcast or podcast. This show is a gift. A diverse, humourous and interesting experience nearly every time. Very, very few other hosts could possibly be as consistently strong as Gross is.",5

Interesting,02/20/2008,NorCal Explorer,Some of the stories on this program are way out there on the left and do not connect to middle America.,1
Not that interesting anymore.,02/23/2008,@!$##&!,I really used to like Fresh Air because of the balance of social and entertainment. But lately it's been a little too heavy on the entertainment portion. One day its a social or political issue and the next three or four are about movies. I enjoyed the old formula better.,3

Incredibly biased,03/15/2008,nolife32,"I cannot believe that so many say that Terry Gross is a great interviewer. True, she is skilled, but is completely unable to hide her ""classical liberalism"" (Secularism).",2
Fresh Air,03/22/2007,Breezzie,I love Terry Gross. Every time I hear it I want to buy the book if she is interviewing an author.,5
the only thing I wish...,03/22/2007,radiolover,"...is that they'd either include the music Terry mentions (""now we'll hear this musician playing/singing..."" - and then they cut directly to the next segment) or cut out her introduction. Otherwise I'd have given this podcast 5 stars! Love Fresh Air...",4
Fresh Air or National Polluted Airwaves,03/29/2007,Royaldiadem,"This is truly Fresh Air for the atheist and naturalist.

I look forward to Fresh air every day,03/31/2007,jamtoe,"Fresh air appears to make an effort to be balanced and fair, which is always hard to do especially in the media, liberal or conservative. I really loved the two day's of interviews with Francis Collins and Richard Dawkins. Dawkins was very eloquent but when he was finished he left us with no hope only a faith in science that a select few will ever share and a certain fascist future.",5

"Diverse, interesting, with a heavy Secular Progressive Bias",04/03/2007,Buckaroo Bonzai,"This show seeks to cover a plethora of topics, and generally does a good job in an in-depth interview about them. However, it proceeds from a foundation firmly rooted in what many would refer to as classic liberalism (or perhaps progressivism?). If you are not of this socio-political persuasion, you may be irked when it covers a topic of interest to you with a surprising bias.",3

The Best,04/18/2007,Big El,"Personal and charming, Terry Gross can make an interview with a rock seem intelligent. She does her research, and explores surprising angles for each guest. Even if the guest does not personally interest me, I know Terry will introduce me to aspects of the guest that I would not have considered. Highly recommended - I have been listening since I was in college.",5
Only Charlie Rose is as good,04/19/2007,ldh100g,"I interviewed Terry Gross for Our Community Press (a now defunct GLBT paper that had a readership of about 35,000). We talked for about an hour. I chose her for a feature because she is consistently the best interviewer on the air.",5
Fresh Air,04/22/2007,Libertarian,"I am sickened that so many people think Terry Gross is great. She is an accomplished interiewer and has a very good concept underlying her show; however, Terry Gross is a hopeless liberal who is totally unable to mask her political affiliation and who, like too many of her colleagues shows her political leanings through the content she chooses for her programs. Terry should stick to interviewing people from the arts and entertainment where most people expect that liberal and illogical views will be espoused; venturing into the political or social field is dangerous territory where Terry will wade fearlessly into the liberal mire where she should not be allowed to enter without a counterweight. That said I still listen to the show as despite its severe shortcomings NPR, of which Fresh Air is a prominent part, is simply the best radio available when the BBC is not airing.",4
Best Ever!,04/30/2007,AK&47,I am so happy that iTunes now has Fresh Air. Terry Gross is a fantastic interviewer and her guests are always interesing.,5
Gasping For Air,05/09/2007,TracyGoode,"I'm not usually one for NPR, but in the last few months I have been listen and I have to say I'm really not impressed with Terry Gross. I don't thinks she asks lookings into anyone she interviews background or has any idea who she is talking to most of the time.When she as chances to ask hard hitting or even relevant questions she blows it.",1
Terry Gross Absolutely Rocks!,05/21/2007,chazzbro,"I've been listening to Fresh Air for probably 15 years. I always wished I could make it a daily habit...but schedules being what they are, that just wasn't possible. She's the best interviewer I've ever heard in my life. Fearless but respectful, she ALWAYS asks the questions I want to hear asked. I cannot say enough good about her. What a great program! Subscribe to this podcast now...you WILL NOT regret it!",5
"Gross is capable, but has her limits.",05/26/2007,mrdjsk,"Just listened to the infamous O'Reilly interview and it was painfully obvious that she had an agenda to attack him from the very first question. O'Reilly scored a knockout, whereas Gross came across as a lightweight out of her element. I much prefer Gross when she talks with Holywood ""luminaries"" or has chit-chat with celebrities. What she lacks in gravitas she makes up for with her uniquely calm, soothing voice.",2
Fantastic interviews,05/28/2007,tboneharbinger,"This podcast (like all of NPR's podcasts) would be so much better if they would put in section breaks to make it easier to move through each podcast.

Yahoo! Fresh Air has come to iTunes!,02/11/2007,Nancy729,"Terry Gross is by far the best interviewer in journalism. Her style is part intimate conversationalist, part tenacious questioner. Her interviews are generous and composed of questions that are not being asked by every other interviewer in the oft times flavorless stew that comprises American contemporary media. As a test, check out her interview with Danny Devito -- it's not schmaltzy confessions, it's as thorough an examination of Devito's inspirations and history as one can experience. Ms. Gross' personal and journalistic curiosity is unmistakable. She is in a league with few peers; her show is fabulous. I agree, though, that there appears to be a technical difficulty with the podcast as some sessions end abruptly.",5

Terry Gross is Awful,02/22/2007,vkv,"Love NPR, Love most of NPR's other podcasts, but this is the worst show on public radio. The format & concept of this show would be redeemable were it not for the host's horrible style. Terry Gross's perpetual confusion & stammering are frustrating.

shows are incomplete,02/23/2007,jonstieg,"i agree with the other reviewers about the shows being cut short. often songs that are spoken about during the episode are not included. they also end early sometimes. it takes away from what is, otherwise, a great podcast. it is the only reason that i gave it a 4 star rating. fresh air is a great podcast and fully deserves to be the most popular in the itunes store.",5

the best interviewer in any medium,03/06/2007,dankaufman.net,Listen to Teri Gross and realize just how bad most of the interviewers you see on TV are. She's not just going down a list of questions.

Finally!,02/05/2007,tb55,Thanks! We need Fresh Air podcasts!,5
"Love the show, but the episodes are incomplete",02/06/2007,Goshinkansen,"Fresh Air is great, but I've listened to three podcasts so far and in each case the podcast ends before the show is over. Hopefully that's not an ongoing problem.",3
Happy to see this here!,01/30/2007,allysther,"Fresh Air is such a wonderful show. I am happy to be able to download it and take it with me as I go about my day. Thank you, NPR!",5
"Oh, happy day.",01/30/2007,ImVan,Awesome awesome awesome to wake up and see Fresh Air is now on iTunes! Thanks NPR and Apple!,5
About Time,01/30/2007,aprattis,Was one of the missing items. NPR makes being an expat all the easier.,5
"Yes,YEs YEs,Yes",01/30/2007,ViaCirca,"Finally, This is my favorite npr show.",5
OMG,01/30/2007,chano45,"I never thought I'd live to see this. This is definitely one of my favorites. Being outside of the States, there was just no way to listen to this very valuable show. Now, I can listen to this whenever, whereever I am. Thank you for making it available to the public.",5
Show of our time,01/30/2007,Doggy Daddy,"I was hoping this show would be released on Podcast. Between HERE AND NOW, WAIT WAIT, and now FRESH AIR my ipod has been taken over. I love Terry's style and interview choices. And now I won't miss a show due to my hectic schedule. Thank you!",5
Finally is right....,01/30/2007,Dubnick,"Hopefully this decision to make Fresh Air available as a free broadcast will not hurt NPR or Fresh Air financially, because if there are three radio programs worth paying for, they are This American Life, Fresh Air, and of coarse, Howard Stern. I'm sure the inclusion of quick sponsored by spots will make up for any lost revenue. Terri Gross is a great interviewer and they almost always have very compelling and interesting guests - I am glad I can now take the daily shows with me for free. Bravo!",5
Excellent!!!,01/30/2007,Arturosurfs,Terry Gross is an excellent interviewer. I am always amazed by her level of knowledge and preperation.,5
At last!,01/30/2007,quesoloco,"Thank you NPR for giving us a podcast of this great show! Terry Gross is an amazing interviewer, and a treasure. Not many could be quite just as at home whether interviewing a senator or the Rza from Wu Tang Clan.",5
Enfin!,01/30/2007,Ingleside Guys,We are paying members of our local NPR affiliate but never could catch Fresh Air at a good time-- kind of felt odd to be paying and not be able to hear our favorite show. But now that's changed-- thank you NPR!,5
I love fresh air,01/30/2007,nforet,I am so happy they decided to podcast fresh air!!!,5
happy happy joy joy,01/31/2007,not unpreposterous,I was just whimpering aloud to someone that I wished wished wished this was available for free -- and my wishes have come true.,5
The greatest interviewer makes it to podcast,01/31/2007,drtedave,Terry Gross is the best in the world. Terry defines public radio and she also sets the bar of how an interview should be conducted. I am so happy to have a podcast access to her show.,5
Thank you Terry,01/31/2007,DDODAL,"Thank you thank you Terry :

Thank Goodness,01/31/2007,THYMIUS,Finally! Now when will we start seeing archived shows? Can't wait!,5
A True Gift,01/31/2007,Sloe Moe,"I've scheduled my lunch hours around being able to listen to Fresh Air on our local NPR affiliate. Now I can go to lunch when I want to and listen to Fresh Air on my iPod. Even when I think I have no interest in the day's guest, I am usually sucked in to a riveting interview. Next to This American Life, Fresh Air is my favorite program on the radio. These are crown jewels gifted to us, and we are all richer for being able to hear them so easily. Thank you WHYY and NPR.",5
Among the best interviews in America...,01/31/2007,KellyOmaha,"Terri Gross has her faults, but the time, research, and thought put into each interview makes her a gift to anyone wanting more from public opinion leaders and the most important figures in the arts. Very pleased that WHYY came to understand that part of the Public in Public Broadcasting these days is accessibility to the widest possible audience... and not just royalties on sales of the program.",5
The best there is,02/01/2007,ratboyy,"At last: Fresh Air, the very best program on the radio, bar none, is available as a podcast.",5
"Great show, why no titles.",12/21/2010,Appreciative reader,"Good show, good questions, a bit too much musical interviews for me, but others like that.

But why no titles on podcasts.",3
Titles,12/23/2010,Laurasmith55,Please add episode subject titles!,4
What is on the podcast?,12/24/2010,ardee1980,Titles please.,3
Titles,12/31/2010,BobbyMac55555,"Why, and how come so many people have requested titles... and yet nothing has come from it? maybe the contents of the pods don't matter from you creators, but to the listener they matter a great deal. do you creators read these reviews. Don't answer if you never read them.",2
Jan. 7 2011 9:28 AM,01/07/2011,Powbhaji,"It's great, but...wouldn't this review have made a lot more sense if there was a freakin' descriptive TITLE?? Please fix this horrible error in judgment!",4
Woohoo! Titles! Or not?,01/08/2011,Miss Kristi,"Love fresh air. Love Terri gross.
Looks like we got titles on the 5th? And today? Nope. :( it'd be nice to always know who you're interviewing beforehand.",4
One of my fav podcasts,01/15/2011,GrahamFreeman,"I listen as least 3x/week, and almost always think it's great. Thanks for all of the interviews on topics of substance.",5
Include a title!!!,01/19/2011,PinkiesOutNYC,"As others have pointed out, it is difficult to know who is being interviewed as there is no title in the podcast description. How does something like this get missed????",4
I get Jay Z...and I don't get the titles,01/23/2011,Grant RAWDIN,"So, I thought the interview with Jay Z was well done, relevant and insightful. Yes he's a rapper, but he represents a brilliant man who started off as many black men do--but who's art was expressed in a form that spoke to his peers, gave hope, taught lessons and gave those of us who have not experienced the life or style a fair perspective. His stories are a doorway and his success an affirmation of the artistic and business savvy that is most often lost in the urban landscape. Bravo.",5
Audio Issues,01/28/2011,Stiral Sparecase,"Love the podcast! Along with the inclusion of succinct titles, please adjust microphone levels so that it's loud enough for iPhone users & there's less volume level fluctuation. Thank you!",4
List by Interview Please,01/30/2011,Friendly Advice Guy,"The date in the title does not help as there is no list anywhere of the show telling who is on it. This rating is not for the show, but the podcast, as we cannot pick the interviews we want.",1

Podcast Titles,04/09/2011,Von Rundstedt,Where are they?,2
Lack of titles is galling,12/18/2010,spikemono,I find it puzzling that this tile issue has never been fixed. Isn't access and usability to the broadest possible audience the goal?,1
