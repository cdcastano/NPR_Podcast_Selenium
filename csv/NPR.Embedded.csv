Amazing podcast,04/22/2019,bulgaria not included,"Amazing in-depth reporting, engaging stories uncovering issues of great concern. The latest series ""How it Ends"" with reporting by Ruth Sherlock is phenomenal. I'm anxiously awaiting each episode. The only thing I don't like is the theme music. It's unnecesarily dramatic. Please consider changing it.",5
Fascinating in-depth reporting,04/20/2019,RN1371,"Every series is a well-documented story, very human in nature. The hosts are clearly dedicated to a compassionate and factual story delivery related to a contemporary topic, while letting their subjects speak in their own voice and from their own experience. Highly recommended.",5
Thank you!!!,04/19/2019,Luminous Connector,Great reporting and storytelling. I learn so much from your podcast. Excellent work. Keep going. Thank you!!!,5
Clearly anti-American. Very disappointed.,04/19/2019,gunguy98,"There is a clear, leftist vibe to these podcasts. I stopped listening after reaching one where the hosts are tell the story (in a very sympathetic way) of Muslims who join Isis and want to come back to their homeland now, after things clearly didn‚Äôt go the way they planned. Absolutely disgusted that they would sympathize to this kind of treason. They should be imprisoned.",1
"Heartbreaking but engaging, interesting and needed",04/18/2019,London99Don'tbuy,"Sad, incredible stories about the people affected by isis",5
Amazing,04/18/2019,Politics Momma,Loved it. So informative.,5
Really?,04/18/2019,Bigtuna18!,Embedded has so much disposable income that they are gonna waste there time reporting on ISIS members. How about something worth your listeners time! How about the 1000 issues happening right here in the USA. So disappointed.......üôÅ,1
Awful in every way you would expect,04/14/2019,BCF200000,Per usual,1
One of the best!,04/11/2019,MethadoneMike,"My wife calls me the 'NPR' JUNKIE. That's because a good 60+ % of my podcasts come from the need outle.
With that said, Embedded ranks right there at the top. It does just what it claims and Goes Deep.",5
I listen to lots of podcasts. This one is the best.,04/08/2019,Surrounded by Children,Embedded is the best podcast out there. I love the reporting and the humanity. I hope there are a lot more episodes coming!,5
First season kills it. After that.....,11/01/2018,Metal Mike Tattoos,This use to be my favorite podcast but has gone done hill since the first season. Return to that format because a whole season on why you hate Trump got boring quickly. I want to learn about stuff not be bored to death.,1
Partisan and sarcastic,11/04/2018,rep10937,"While the stories she presents are interesting. She does so in a way that does not allow for any differing opinion. I‚Äôm a bit tired of all the sarcastic comments and tones when talking about anything related to republicans or our police forces. Take a look at the economy! We‚Äôve done a good job! How about some journalistic integrity? I for one, would like a podcast like this with some of that involved.",1
Getting to Leftists,11/05/2018,Statewes,Used to love this podcast but it‚Äôs gotten way to left wing political. Please stick to the good stories you originally had and get off the right wing bashing. Thanks,3
Are you related,11/09/2018,premenopausalme,Are you related to Sara Koenig(spelling) you sound exactly like her. Love your shows,5

Always Getting Better!,11/25/2018,CWinders,"I started listening to Embedded when it was first released in the summer of 2016. The breadth and depth of material that Kelly has covered since then amazes me. She and the show are a versatile duo, pushing sensitive buttons and deep diving into topics that being uncomfortable truths to the surface. Keep up the incredible storytelling!",5
Love this podcast!,01/15/2019,Marissa939597,This podcast is so interesting and I‚Äôve learned so much. I love how you take today‚Äôs biggest headlines and put real life stories to them. Helps to contextualize the importance of these headlines. Thank you!!!! Please do more!,5
Great Show!,01/25/2019,DA setters,I love the fact that they take the time to be accurate in their reporting. The coal stories really hit close to home. My family is from the region and in my lifetime seeing the decline is really heartbreaking.,5
The House,01/31/2019,salindquist,"I really like Embedded and would give this 5 stars but I am noticing lately, and not just in this podcast, but even for example Oprah‚Äôs super soul conversations which I listen to quite a bit as well, at how fast people are talking. I just want to comment on the speed and cadence of the narrative. I am not sure if this is something podcast hosts have fallen into by nature of the task or if something else is going on, but for some reason I feel like the narration is all of a sudden on overdrive. Curious if anyone else notices this as well.",4
Really Deep Dives by the Inspiring Kelly McEvers,02/05/2019,Alicia Magee,"I don't think I've found any other podcast that goes so deep into important issues like this. This podcast knows what it's trying to do and it does it well. You will come out far more informed than you thought you could be, and McEvers is an excellent host.",5
‚ÄúAfter the Storm‚Äù is excellent,02/21/2019,Charli Bull,"I re-lived the desperation of not having power and the relief when it came back while listening to this episode. And my family and I were very lucky because we got our power back in 47 days. The incompetence of both the Federal and local government in the aftermath was incredible. The problems in Puerto Rico persist today and we don‚Äôt see any light at the end of the tunnel... there is no viable economic plan, we feel like 2nd rate US citizens, the government continues politicking with every possible issue, oppressive laws, like the Jones Act, continue to strangle every citizen, and there is little knowledge in the mainland of all these issues. Thank you, NPR, for bringing some of these topics to light.",5
Tremendously engaging,02/21/2019,Cynroles,I love all of the content! I‚Äôm always excited when I see there‚Äôs a new episode available. My ONLY complaint is that there‚Äôs not more content being uploaded more often. I understand it takes time to cover the stories the way this podcast does. I just want more! Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode,5
An NPR Gem,02/25/2019,StPeteFlJames,"Focuses on critical issues, tells a compelling story, balances in-depth with the big picture, and Kelly is a pleasure to listen to. This one of the few podcasts I really look forward to.",5
Captivating and creative,03/05/2019,wendy nathalia,I love the perspective in this series. Great job diving into these topics in such a detailed and efficient manner. So many interesting stories that you usually don‚Äôt get enough of in online articles or news,5

EVERY Parent should listen to this!,03/22/2019,NgaireSG,"He groomed adults whilst abusing children. This should be a cautionary tale for all parents. Listen to your children and believe them.

Great job..,03/28/2019,juanc mtz 21,"This podcast is great in order to have a clear idea of how different topics affect our everyday life.
I enjoy every episode, please keep it coming.",4
How it ends is amazing,04/06/2019,kayeskayes,"I just listened to the first episode of how it ends. It is an amazing feat of in depth journalism and asking ethical questions. I believe that all the Jihadis chose to join the fight in order to impose their twisted worldview. They are not redeemable. These guys should die where they stand, maybe hurry off to meet the waiting virgins. However, after listening to episode one I am questioning my own view. Bravo for putting some doubt in my already made up mind.",5
The Vocal Fry is Strong in This One,04/06/2019,arfy66213467,So much more entertaining after Mueller findings. There were tears in the studio that day...,1
Great work Kelly and Team!,07/19/2018,Joem500,The story-telling style of real news events with the facts and frontline reporting is phenomenal listening. Great work.

Coal Miner,08/11/2018,Lemmelook5,As a Illinois coal miner of 10 years from a mining family third generation the miner piece was so well done from the politics of Mining to the real reason why coal in the US looked up for a second.

Has gone down hill,08/21/2018,amdbdbkendb,"Used to be a really good show when they‚Äôd actually get EMBEDDED to make an episode. Now they just go for the low hanging fruit talking about Trump, to the point where they‚Äôre even in repeats with the topics they focus on with Trump",2
Finally a voice I can listen to...,08/21/2018,rainy day in california,Kelly McEvers has the best voice in podcasting IMHO. And the content is amazing... Thank you!,5

Back to the old format!,06/22/2018,Johnfhdis,"PLEASE go back to the format of Season 1. There‚Äôs so much police video and Trump coverage in the news already. In-depth, original stories were the best part of Embedded, and made it the best podcast on the NPR network. Now every week feels like an uninteresting retread.",1
Should be required listening for all HS Students,06/26/2018,t.sneed,Embedded is informative and digs deep into various stories. This podcast is for all ages and we should encourage people to listen to this and similar podcasts to get a better understanding of what people throughout the country are going through.,5

Not very diverse.,06/28/2018,theoriginalwjburr,"If you want to hear how much they hate Trump or how coal miners get their jobs, then this is the podcast for you.",2
Fantastic story telling,06/28/2018,NPR SheFan,Kelly McEvers is an amazing talent who has a natural skill in conversation which draws the listener in. Her stories offer enriching perspectives. The show is extremely well produced.,5
Totally biased,06/29/2018,Southern professional,"Ms. McEvers is one of those reporters whose take on the news is totally biased. She is not an objective reporter, rather a podcaster out to further her anti republican agenda. The first season of Embedded was very good. Unfortunately since then it has been increasingly disappointing. After deleting so many episodes I have now unsubscribed.",1
Not a balanced perspective,06/29/2018,Andrieux,"Everything this podcast creates is from a neo-liberal perspective. Im no fan of trump, not a republican either, but their bias shows a bit too much in everything they report",1
Great investigative reporting,06/29/2018,Erin79705,"I respect the work and opinions being produced here. I often disagree with folks being interviewed, but I‚Äôm curious about their lives and experiences nevertheless‚Äîand I think McEvers feels the same way. Some people may criticize her conclusions, but I believe she arrives there using a balanced and rational approach. I applaud the show for having the chutzpah to call a spade a spade in this degenerating and disingenuous age.",5

Excellent journalism.,07/06/2018,cb216100,"In a world of garbage news it‚Äôs so refreshing to listen to well researched, thoughtful journalism. I‚Äôm entertained as much as I am enlightened by these stories.",5
Necessary.,07/06/2018,jlwerd,I needed this podcast. I don‚Äôt get politics and I have no idea what Trump is up to. This helps me,5

nprnerd4life,07/14/2018,nprnerd4life,I appreciate so much the depth in this show. Thank you for taking so much time to research and make these episodes! We need more of this kind of news.,5
Incredible Reporting,07/17/2018,Alllllllie,"This is an absolutely fantastic show! Kelly is an engaging storyteller you really brings you into the story each week. No matter the topic, I am also intrigued by the stories on embedded and the way the podcast is crafted. If you like Serial, S-town, Invisibilia, This American Life, or just good reporting, you will love this show!",5
ALL GOOD,07/18/2018,Bachspielerin,"The TRUMP and COAL STORIES were especially good, but I appreciate the total involvement in each story, giving a full and 365-degree picture of each person and event involved.",5
Left wing extremist‚Äôs view of the world,07/18/2018,Danielwang88,"It is fun how Americans see the world. On one hand, they think view their poors, inner city population, veterans are lazy, sick people, on the other hand they believe all foreigners are angels should be welcomed to this ‚Äúgreatest‚Äù country. One hand most they do not believe votes count, on the other hand, they want to give all illegal immigrants right to vote.",3
Kelly et al,07/19/2018,Jba314,Amazingly informative . Thank you so much.,5
Love Embedded,06/03/2018,KathyB3000,Providing podcasts that tell the stories of real people really brings the listener into situations otherwise not able to fully appreciate. Very well done.,5

Understanding,06/06/2018,Vicki LTP,You should alway want to see the others side point of view. Thank you for such great reporting.,5
"The Bikers episode, April 2016",06/07/2018,Mateoman11,"It‚Äôs odd when the narrator says: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know the role the police payed in all this.‚Äú Actually, you do. The police have a chain of command, follow procedures, write reports, and do internal investigations. Yes, police make mistakes at times. Yet, are much more trustworthy than biker clubs. You did an investigative report for a few weeks. Law enforcement lives there, know the streets, know the criminals, and take their time. ‚ÄúWhat role did NPR play in all this?‚Äù They didn‚Äôt do much homework, and then generalized about what might be. Seems like poor reporting.",1
Not really about coal,06/08/2018,Guy guy guy guy,I subscribed to this podcast in season 1 right after Trump got elected thinking that it was going to be a fair critique on the presidency and quickly found out that these ‚Äúreporters‚Äù had an agenda and unsubscribed. I came back after hearing a promo on Planet Money and was hoping the journalists took a different route. But now it has become a Podcast all about who were these voters that were obviously uninformed in their decision making and cost the Democrats their surprising presidential loss. So if you are left wing enjoy. If you are moderate or right wing you will easily hear the propaganda.,2
Coal Stories Enlightenment,06/08/2018,CynthiasDaughter,This was my first EMBD series but certainly not my last. The humanity and deftness with which the stories were told gave me insight and made me feel connected to the people and the community being highlighted in a way I would never have expected. Thank you!,5
Coal Series,06/08/2018,Newsguy8,Amazing Journalism...Thank you. Binged all 5 episodes on my daily walks. Can't wait to explore more from these outstanding journalist.,5
Difficult voice to listen to,06/09/2018,79cmb,"The content is great on Embedded. However, I have a really hard time with the host voice. Not sure if it‚Äôs the tone or the way she stresses her words. Anyhow, I‚Äôm having to let go of this one unfortunately.",3
Details on trump outstanding,06/11/2018,petriebunch,Great in depth history on the vulgar mans rise to power.,5
Great in-depth content,06/11/2018,SoCal-REO,I appreciated the review of the Trump collusion facts. There are so many characters involved that your methodical podcast series was extremely helpful in spelling it out.,5
A must listen,06/14/2018,Colinalcarz,"Especially the episodes devoted to understanding Trump. Incredibly carefully prepared, documented, cited, and written. Sometimes I do find a repetitive inflection pattern somewhat annoying but for the most part, very professional.",4
Awesome Podcast,06/16/2018,jsslanders,Embedded is such a great podcast. Kelly and her team take a deep dive into stories that you will never get in a 2 min newscast. It‚Äôs insightful and engaging reporting.,5

Great podcast,06/19/2018,Cotation,"Coal stories wasn‚Äôt nearly as good as the previous episodes. They could have cut that short by half. Otherwise, great podcast, I‚Äôm sure lot of hard work!",4
Love this Podcast!,06/21/2018,Npruitt99,"This is my absolute favorite. I didn‚Äôt find it until the Coal Stories, which is what made me fall in love on the first place. I love how it took me there and helped me to see the issue through their eyes. After that series, I went back and listened to prior episodes and they were top notch. My #1 podcast for sure.",5
Phenomenal Storytelling,05/24/2018,RSimonLee,There's a nuance to Kelly's style of storytelling and the audio editing of of this podcast that truly sets it apart. You can tell she loves what she does and she does extensive research to bring as much to the listener as possible. Great podcast.,5
Pro-Trump podcast - Refreshing!,05/25/2018,Luv2shopping,The coal miner episodes are squarely pro-Trump. Always enjoy hearing some good news for a change.,5

"Content is good, Delivery is mostly good",05/27/2018,j footprint,"OK, This isn't a bad program, but I have a very difficult time listening to Kelly's delivery and cadence. I don't know anyone who talks like that in real life, and I find it terribly distracting with respect to the content. It's not breathless, like the beautiful people on the nightly news, but it is overenunciated, and stilted.",2
Better than a detective story!,05/29/2018,Curious and Concerned,Thrilling reportage. Thank you! Can‚Äôt wait for more...,5
One of my favorites,05/29/2018,mrespiritu,So good. Only wish there were more episodes. They will sometimes go weeks/months till we get a new story but it‚Äôs worth it.,5

"Great, In-Depth Look at Things that Matter",05/30/2018,Go4sharon,"The team at embed continuously knocks it out of the park. Have listened to the past couple of seasons and just started the Coal episodes, which are so important. I‚Äôm thankful that they are here to tell them.",5
Great listening,05/30/2018,Racer1010,"I really enjoy listening to this podcast because the host explains the topics in a way that I can actually understand the issues they are trying to convey.

"Good content, hosts just ok",06/02/2018,Larispie,"I really enjoy hearing the in-depth reporting about a variety of topics.
I‚Äôm not thrilled with the delivery. Classic ‚ÄúNPR voice‚Äù from Kelly, meaning she wishes she was Ira Glass, so she affects his tics. A lot of the word ‚Äúlike‚Äù, which makes her sound less intelligent than I‚Äôm sure she is.",4
Season 1 was good,06/03/2018,Kc1985ks,Nothing worth listening to after season 1.,1

Started out with promise now not so much,05/12/2018,goat2215,"Prefacing this by saying that I am somebody who leans left on a lot of issues - this podcast is much of what is wrong with the polarization of america. Although I enjoyed the early iterations of this podcast (seriously, the deep dive into opioids was fascinating), every season since then just feels like everything the right mocks about npr with storytelling from a left perspective. This coming from somebody sympathetic to the anti-trump viewpoint, it still feels like an anti-trump podcast with no direction anymore. I love npr but don‚Äôt know if I can‚Äôt donate in good conscience after listening to the last couple seasons after this as it stopped being objective in any way.",2
Enjoyed Broad Topics,05/14/2018,BusinessRaptor,"I've enjoyed this podcast very much. I especially enjoy the variety of topics and in depth look at life from different lenses. I hope it veers away from Trump in future episodes. Many of the Trump episodes have been good and enlightening, but I don't want to lose the other important stories you could tell.",2
Well Done,05/14/2018,liverwurst,"Each series is better than the last, I can't imagine how you can top this season.",5
Beautiful work,05/17/2018,KarlaRuth,"All of those involved with Embedded are doing wonderful work, the stories feel well researched, thorough and flow like any good story should. The photography is amazing. I really appreciate the recent focus on coal country, as this is a part of America often overlooked. Many different viewpoints are included, and listening along feels like a conversation with friends trying to make sense of complex issues. You don't always agree with your friends, but that's when it becomes more important to listen. I am sad when the stories end and look forward to the next one each week. Thank you folks of Embedded!!",5
Liberal views and agenda are hard to hide,05/17/2018,trosenl2,"These podcasts have a serious liberal agenda. Take the coal stories for example, all they are is the negative side of coal. Wyoming produces 4 times more coal than any other state in the US and never a word is mentioned about Wyoming.",2
Extraordinary,05/18/2018,Mfpaluch,One of the best podcasts out there!,5
Best background information on coal,05/18/2018,Doktor Z,"I subscribed to Embedded and caught the series on the Trump administration. It was done in that breezy, informational way NPR reports on subjects, a great way to learn in my opinion. I looked forward to the series on coal. I've lived in West Virginia all my life. From 1949 to 1976, I lived in north central West Virginia, in Clarksburg while growing up and in Morgantown while going to school. There was quite a bit of coal mined in these areas until about 1993 when the Clean Air Act passed. Most of the coal in north central WV is of the high sulphur variety, high BTU but very bad to burn because of the sulphur. In 1977 I moved to southern WV. The southern WV coal belt is mostly south of US RT. 60 and west of I-77 (the WV Turnpike). Coal down here is low sulphur. A lot of it is metalurgical coal but also a lot of steam (power generation) coal. Unlike north central WV, the economy, except for Charleston and Huntington (the two largest cities in the state) is not diversified. Coal is king, with politicians but also with the people. It was a job that without any education other than the 80 miners' certification course, you could possibly earn over $100,000/year. Your series hit the nail on the head. Lots of people want coal to ""come back."" They don't realize that it won't. Not only will clean air and waste disposal requirements hinder this but the good coal is gone. Quite often a coal company will have to cut through 30"" of rock (usually sandstone) to get at 16"" of coal. No matter how hard miners work, you can't make money this way. The vast majority of people, including quite a few with some education, would never read a business publication, such as Forthune, Forbes, Business Week, or the Wall Street Journal. If they did, they would learn who is buying the coal or not buying it. They don't understand how fracking affects coal. A powerplant can burn natural gas, which is cheap because of fracking, for a bit more than one fourth the cost of coal. But people love fracking because it upsets environmentalists (a very dirty word in many people's vocabularies). It's a very sad situation. However, ignoring the facts or wishing them to be otherwise won't help. Keep up the good work on this series. You've done very well so far and I look forward the the remainder.",5

Good show until they got overly political,02/23/2018,emeon,I enjoyed this show until it got into the political topics.

True journalism,02/18/2018,T-Lur,Show is filled with facts...a word that seems to be getting lots and lots of different definitions these days...such a relief to listen to a show that‚Äôs purely to inform...excellent work folks.,5
Informative and easy to listen to,02/18/2018,ash.teleki,"While most political shows are biased, this show while trying to prove their point also considers the other side of the story and then has a rebuttal to put it down. The background music is nice to hear and doesn‚Äôt take away from the content. While I do not know a lot about politics, I definitely feel more involved just by listening in on a few shows and I understand what is being said as opposed to many shows which use bigger words and more sophisticated diction that would confuse, I assume, a large amount of people who should be more informed about what is actually going on in our own government.",5

Trump Kushner Story,12/14/2017,missyb814,What an anti semitic crap story. NPR should be embarrassed about producing this. Liberals are anti semitic idiots. They are the ones continuing Hitlers path. Not Trump. Obama hated the jewish people. Get your facts right. Im impressed with the Kushner family success and they have every right to it and to shower their children with a beautiful life. Jewish ppl did not come here as refugees after WWII anti semitic america didnt want them here either so there is no comparison to what Trump is doing.

In depth,11/15/2017,ucasizolo,"I loved the first season, which stayed a bit more true to the show's tagline - taking a story from the headlines and going deep. The episodes about the opiate crisis were especially effective. The 3rd season about Trump and his business history is interesting as well, but I'm a little exhausted by everything being Trump coverage these days... there are other news stories going on that could be fruitfully explored by Kelly McEvers",4

Character Assassination,11/04/2017,Spacekaddet99,Previous series of Embedded were awesome. This one on Trump is pure biased character assassination with reporter contempt unabashedly present in every innuendo.

Meh... another great investigative journalism show ruined by NPR‚Äôs personal politics.,11/10/2017,Andrew in TX,Well done NPR. What was once a serious journalism show has devolved into a shameless anti-Trump hit piece full of weak attempts to associate the president with ‚Äúthe Russians‚Äù and shady convicts. Too bad. I really enjoyed previous seasons of embedded. Unsubscribe.,1
Used to be good,11/10/2017,shutterbug_8,"I used to like this podcast when it explored different topics. Now it is only ever ""Trump Stories"" why not just make a new podcast about Trump instead of ruining this one by changing it. Sad to unsubscribe, but I am annoyed by this.

Amazing reporting,10/26/2017,DrTouch,"I hear that embedded was going to start a series of episodes about Trump from another podcast I listen to (I think planet money). I had not been very interested in Embedded before, the episodes just weren‚Äôt what I wanted to listen to. But I have been listening to the new episodes and I‚Äôm blown away by how great and in-depth the reporting is for the Trump series, and it has made me a fan. It‚Äôs kind of like Radiolab, but for investigative journalism. I hope all the shows are as great as they have been recently! Definitely worth listening to!",5
Awesome podcast.,10/27/2017,shelbyreviewinstuff,"Loving the new podcasts and updates on past episodes. Can't wait for more!

Thoughtfully and Thoroughly Done,10/29/2017,Isaac.Bickerstaff,"Embedded is an outstanding news podcast. Kelly McEvers is careful to distinguish what she knows, hearsay and how trustworthy it is, and what she doesn't know. She distinguishes facts from her feelings.",5
Excellent!,10/29/2017,Joey Bag'o'Donuts,I look forward to every episode!,5
Another smear attempt by a bunch of liberals,10/29/2017,Meat Monkey,"Another show by NPR liberals with the effort to skew reality into their distorted, fictitious, feminist and made up facts to push their ‚Äúwish they were true‚Äù point of view. Another great example of why the federal government show quit funding NPR.",1
Plot hole S2E4,10/30/2017,NinaFromChic@g0,"Season 2 is quite compelling, but one thing has been under my skin all morning... the Jared Kushner episode skips over how he became entangled with Donald Trump. Nothing is said of Ivanka (her name doesn‚Äôt even appear in the episode), how she and Jared met, or what the Jared-DT relationship was like before 2015. The show makes it seem like Kushner was managing the 666 building one minute and working on Trump‚Äôs campaign the next. This ‚Äúplot hole‚Äù is wildly distracting. Naturally, it leaves the listener wondering whether the Trumps were directly involved in the deals to save that building or whether Trump was relying on Kushner before he ran for president.",4
Good First Season,10/30/2017,Goodmutt,The first season of this show was awesome. It took an in-depth look at a wide range of issues and made it a point to show both sides as human. I learned a lot and it helped change my perspective on real-world issues.,3

Don‚Äôt Ever Stop!,10/31/2017,Woman-at-Stonehaven,"I am a very recent listener to Embedded and while the stories are disturbing (trump, kushner and bannon), they are so important. They should be required listening to anyone who has ever even thought about voting.",5
Sarcasm,10/31/2017,dakinebraddah,"Can the sarcasm in their voice be any stronger? This new season all anti-trump. I am not a trump fan, but sometimes the NPR podcasts are so to the Democratic Party that I fear I am not getting a comprehensive, both sided information. I love the NPR podcasts though and will continue listening, but gotta listen knowing that I'm getting only the opinion of one side.",3

Terrific Reporting,11/02/2017,ThumpNix,"Embedded goes farther, digs deeper, and leaves me feeling that I have an appreciation for the bigger picture and the questions that should be asked to get somewhere near the unvarnished truth.

Disappointing,10/23/2017,DisappointedinSoCal,"I am an avid listener of NPR and really enjoyed the last season of Embedded (Police Shootings). However, I could not be more disappointed in the current season (Trump Stories). I have listened to the first three episodes and am distressed at the apparent bias. I am not a fan of President Trump. I dislike both his personality and his politics. But even so, it troubles me that a show like Embedded would dig up dirt as eagerly as it does. I look to Embedded for quality journalism, but the current season is merely peddling politically motivated character attacks.",1

Mesmerizing,10/18/2017,ChuckieChubb,"Some of the best and thorough journalistic storytelling I been exposed to...maybe ever. I believe I‚Äôm hearing all sides.

Trump Stories,10/12/2017,SuddenSal,Thanks for this excellent investigative reporting. I wish more people could have heard stories like these before the election.

Good start on Trump,10/17/2017,x3steffi22,The first two episodes are well done. I wanted the man who was talking about the bad things Trump said behind the scenes at The Apprentice to be a lot more specific. I guess that part got cut out of this segment. For future segments I am looking for a discussion of money laundering done by Trump as detailed in The NY Times. It's sure to be one hot topic for the Mueller investigation but I'm sure you can tell the story more effectively for us non-lawyers.,5

"Fantastic investigative approach, super engaging",09/17/2017,DesertEagle77,"Embedded is one of the best podcasts I've ever listened to. The police series and the biker series are some of my favorite, I've listened to multiple times. Only complaint is that Kelly has taken a hiatus temporarily.",5
Used to love this podcast,09/18/2017,Casterlistener,"I loved listening to this podcast. Every episode was a new and interesting insight. Now? Well now they are just going political. It's a shame. They were good. So if you wanted to listen to something that was interesting and was something you don't hear everyday I wouldn't listen to this. It's just bandwagoning, muckraking yellow journalism. If that's your thing. Have a ball. As for me I'm done with them. Also I'm not a Trump fan. I'm just sick of it all",1
Great show!,10/01/2017,Queen Lory,Do not miss this show,5
Taking a pass on season 3,10/05/2017,S-dub_78,I‚Äôve enjoyed this podcast in the past but I can‚Äôt stomach a full season delving into the past of our commander in chief. I chose not to watch his game show then and now I‚Äôm choosing not to hear about it now. Hope to pick this up again once this season is over.,3
Why Trump?,10/05/2017,Mile1,"This was a great show, until it followed every other tv show, podcast, and other outlet down the easy path of ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù journalism.",2
Can't get enough!!,10/05/2017,ValdezMarissa2018,I've been subscribed so I was pleasantly surprised when I heard Embedded come on this morning. I didn't want it to end!! I can't wait for the next episode!,5
Here we go again...,10/05/2017,Zeestella,"For like the millionth time this year. Is the ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù not tired of always covering Donald Trump and how terrible he is? Embedded has hardly ever actually ‚Äúembedded‚Äù themselves in any topic they covered save for the few. I‚Äôve been listening since the beginning, but this ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù person done now. I‚Äôll stick with the non political stuff NPR puts out if they can manage that.",1
Unsubscribed,10/06/2017,Bert Humperdinck,Of all the topics to cover in the new season they choose Trump?! As if we don‚Äôt hear enough about this man. I‚Äôll pass on NPR‚Äôs nuanced coverage of the soulless piece of garbage that is the US president.,1
Very informative and interesting,10/06/2017,SamiaP,"Love the show- I keep wishing more of this information came out before the election, but I'm glad Kelly is digging into this now.",5
Another Trump-bashing podcast‚Ä¶,10/07/2017,GGGirl29,"How original, another Trump-bashing podcast. It‚Äôs disappointing, even if it is expected at this point. I‚Äôve been a subscriber of Embedded since the first episode and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one they‚Äôll lose. Sad thing is that I‚Äôm not even a Trump fan, just sick of listening to the 24/7 hate that apparently passes for ‚Äúnews‚Äù in America now.",1
Poor Narration,10/07/2017,Verified,"I was eager to hear the recent story about Trump/Apprentice. Sadly I had to stop it after a few minutes due to the exceedingly annoying Valley Girl, growly, tone of the narrator. It overpowered anything she had to say that might have been of interest.",1
Just a liberal bias hit piece,10/09/2017,Magoobee,"I have no problem with hit pieces but to think that just Republicans are bad, is just plain naive, stupid and actually corrupt. 8 years of Obama's incompetence & corruption and the media just looks away and even worse, praises him. The job of a free press is to keep EVERYONE in power honest, not just the ones you don't like. Your suppose to be Journalist not Activists.",1
"Expedient Topics, Expertly Crafted, Gem of a Pod",10/09/2017,Avre‚ÄôAffee,"McEvers and crew have put together a great podcast! The topics are relevant and intriging. There is a personal and resepctful nature to how the subjects are treated. This is what journalism is supposed to be and do. Thank you for making this happen, NPR.",5
Listener from the Beginning,10/11/2017,Suz7284,"I've listened to ""Embedded"" since the beginning. I have loved the podcast and recommended to several friends. I'm excited for this new season, but want to make sure all listeners are aware that this is not just pure journalism. It seems to be a liberal leaning (let's be honest, more than leaning) propaganda podcast. I'll still listen, but I also smart enough to recognize your agenda, Kelly:)",2
Love the in depth reporting,10/12/2017,Nancygr00,Starting strong with a fantastic new season of smart and thoughtful reporting.,5
Trump bashing,10/12/2017,Monte love,"Obviously no regard for the half of this country that support our president.
I would love to hear the same stories about the Clintons. However, I highly doubt that would ever be done",1
Kelly McEvers is crazy!,10/12/2017,Mike Rabe,Very in depth and fantastic reporting by Kelly McEvers. She goes to so many crazy places and gets the inside scoop. Very interesting content. A must listen. I must say the new season is a much different tone and less daring but still interesting.,5
Great deep dive!,10/12/2017,Knikatknight,Well researched and delivered. Thank you for the great work and keep it up!,5
Really enjoy it.,10/12/2017,E_DeJager,"I like the pace of this podcast. It tells stories thoughtfully, but it‚Äôs definitely compelling and I‚Äôm eager to hear more.",5
Police,05/02/2017,Stauffje,"Police cast was great report on all criminal justice theory. Theory is great, in theory it should work. People have different understandings of theory and interpret it how they want. Leads to differences in police discretion. Like that in every unit.",4
Amazing Reporting,05/08/2017,Drmpro8,"This podcast is for anyone looking for captivating and in-depth reporting. It focuses on interviews, on the spot accounts of what's happening, and a review of evidence to get the most comprehensive account of the stories they cover. It's absolutely one of the best podcasts I've come across.",5
Wonderful Find,05/16/2017,Wedevag,Three episodes in and I'm addicted. If you're a fan of Sword and Scale you will love this.,5
Incredible show!,05/17/2017,AleeFairOh,This is an amazing podcast. Highly recommend!,5
Really important and interesting!,05/30/2017,Nawlins7777,Love this podcast! Learned so much from it and can't wait for more! In depth journalism like this is such a blessing right now. They spend a months researching and developing a story to give us a 40 min episode. I hope they get to keep making these because this is the kind of journalism that informs and breaks down the idea that news must be quick and click bait-y. Thanks for all the hard work!,5
More please!,06/01/2017,Sarasmiles66,"Keep them coming, these are great!",5
Great podcast!,06/14/2017,LesleighWag,From the moment the theme music starts playing I'm hooked. I just wish there were more episodes!,4
Pushes the envelope,06/23/2017,Khglynn,Both in their reporting and their tech. I love the texting feature from the last episode. Very cool! Keep it up embedded team!,5
Amazing,06/27/2017,Eurythmicskkllmmnnii,"I love this podcast- thoughtful, humanizing, and easy to follow. Like watching a vice documentary-- Kelly McEvers maintains all the depth and humanity that video could.",5
Journalism at Its Best,07/13/2017,Lmwf,Keep up the good work!,5
When do we get more,07/18/2017,tim waiting,Waiting on more. Embedded started off like gang busters. Now so long a wait for more. Kelly when is next story,5
What news should be,07/29/2017,consumerjdz,"I'm not a review guy, but more people should be listening to this. Sorry for the paucity of the review, time constraints, just wanted to get my 5-stars on record.",5
Don't Miss It,08/08/2017,easygoing_surf,Riveting reporting!,5
Deep dives into important stories,08/24/2017,tarheelmommy,I've really learned a lot about topics that aren't part of my everyday life but that are really important.,5
Fantastic,08/24/2017,Seasyrah,Great stories. Wonderful narrator - easy to listen to! Thanks for all the great investigations.,5
New podcast obsession!,08/24/2017,Penguinigurl,"After listening to the first episode, I was hooked on this podcast. And after listening to about 8 more in the last week, I still can't get enough. The content is heavy, but if you're like me and love to learn about things that are important, you will enjoy the podcast. Highly recommend!",5
This American Life on reality steroids,09/06/2017,KASPDX,"Actually, earlier episodes could be called This Non-American Life. I just discovered this series and listened to every episode in one day. You need to be a bit of a dark-side-of-humanity junky but it's painfully good. I've seen some of the negative reviews and find them both valid and overly harsh. It's not a ""good news"" show and delves into and maybe dwells upon some of our most intractable societal problems. But the reporting is good--painfully so. While it does approach macabre voyeurism, it's necessary to approach that line in order to get an in depth look at unpleasant issues like drug abuse, motorcycle gang wars, challenges of race and policing, suicide, practicing medicine in war zones, etc. I'm glad that there are reporters that do this kind of reporting, but God knows why they subject themselves to it. It makes me worry for their mental health a bit. But, each and every episode has informed and sometimes altered my own perspective. That's what is great about NPR and this is another great example of that.",4
The best podcast from NPR,09/06/2017,Omar6488,They make every story interesting even when you think the topic wouldn't interest you. It feels like your watching a documentary in your mind. Can't wait for the next season of Embedded.,5
"Not really ""Embedded""",09/08/2017,Vintage Misha,"To ended oneself is to affix or attach themselves and so in this podcast there are a few stories that this does happen, 'The Bikers' and 'The House' while 'The Artic' came close but the producers messed it up. The rest of the podcast comes off as more in depth subject specific and often times speculation based special reports, not podcasts. I wanted, based on the podcast title and description, wanted that raw and gritty embedded non biased storytelling as opposed to the new story based on big headlines... this could be great but right now it is simple mediocre. Additionally, I far prefer Tom Dreisbach over Kelly... not sure why.",2
Come back!,09/11/2017,AP from CA,Perhaps my favorite podcast. Absolutely excellent reporting and extraordinary story telling. I miss you guys. When are you coming back??,5
So...white people are just evil? And cops are murderers?,03/29/2017,Dirtydwg,"This is nothing but elite upper class university children talking about things they don't fully understand...Flagstaff was a disgusting episode. A cop shot a man and had to kill him and they want to blame the cop for protecting himself and his community. Perfect way to start the podcast is ""we dive into these police shootings, normally and unarmed BLACK MAN"" this is propaganda against white males and your looking for race issues that in MOST cases isn't even there!",1
Consistently interesting and thorough podcast,03/30/2017,cjmorrissey,"These stories are extremely interesting. Kelly is a delight to listen to. You can tell a lot of thought, time and research goes into each episode on the part of everyone involved. I'm fairly new to podcasts but this is the best I've come across so far.",5
Good perspective,04/01/2017,The sam stet,It's amazing entertainment which I enjoyed.,5
A bit bleak but great reporting,04/04/2017,Smellulata,"Love the show! The series about police shooting videos was weighing on me, but the last 2 episodes were great and offered interesting different perspectives on the entire issue. Highly recommend!",5
Excellent,04/05/2017,Connor90254,This is my new must-listen (sorry Radio lab.) I love this show. The topics are interesting. The concept of going deep into a story is awesome. And Kelly is a great host. 5 stars.,5
amazing investigative reporting,04/06/2017,Not great and too many ads,"I held off on listening to this one as I've been on podcast overload, but I'm so glad I finally listened. Loved the first set of stories and binged on all of them. Keep it up!",5
Riveting,04/07/2017,kdo42,It's nice to be able to hear the full story of what's going on.,5
BEST,04/10/2017,Lalalalali1296,"I listened to every podcast in less than a week. I really appreciate the 360 degree insight on really complex topics/questions. I would appreciate more coverage on controversial topics, like refugees and human trafficking",5
"Brilliant coverage, quality production",04/12/2017,LorenzoJones,"Kelly and Tom (and other occasional correspondents) do a wonderful job painting the picture for their story. The stories are not too long or short and completely captivate me. If I can't watch documentaries at work, this is the next best thing.",5
Amazing podcast,04/12/2017,Swanbug,I love the reporter of this podcast and the stories they cover. Keep up the amazing work!!,5
Love this podcast,04/13/2017,Anna Negrete,"I love this podcast and the variety of topics and ideas it presents. There's no opinions or one side verses the other, just pure truth and experiences",5

True Fair and Balanced reporting,04/15/2017,Matheson Harris,This latest season has shown me what fair and balanced really can be. Kelly gets at every angle of an issue. Top-notch.,5

I'm Hooked,04/27/2017,AuLu,"This has quickly become one of my favorites & I appreciate the length of the episodes-mostly short enough to finish in a single commute, but also so good I am often left wanting more. Great narration & subject matter. Please keep it coming!",5
Excellent podcast!!,04/29/2017,Cipps76,"I love this podcast. My only complaint would be I wish it were longer. Anything I've heard from npr is really good and this continues that. Great, great job to all who create this show. I Look forward to more episodes",5
Voice,04/30/2017,Britannia 13,Giving real people a voice. Important issues that are getting pushed aside in the media by the distractions of the current administration. Thank you!,5
Love,05/01/2017,Timmayxyz,I heard about this podcast from Livewire Radio one Saturday on NPR. Decided to look it up and now I'm hooked. I love that Kelly actually looks deeper into the story than the usual 30-second headline most news companies settle with. This doesn't answer all the questions but fulfills my insatiable appetite for more information on those headlines.,5
One of the best!,03/16/2017,kadoodie,Great insight. I always enjoy listening even through the episodes about difficult topics. I'm grateful you that I'm able to to listen to this podcast!,5
Thank you!,03/16/2017,Jcaesar81,I've loved it so far.,5
Wake up,03/17/2017,Falooiin,"With the overwhelming amount of awfulness that is happening around the world, it is so easy to feel desensitized. Embedded awakens the soul! Each episode captures the essence of the people and the environment. The audio is raw and real.",5
Never a bad story!,03/19/2017,Flex.Long,I devour each podcast as soon as it is released. Never a bad story! Thanks for the hard work that goes into everyone of your stories.,5

Bikers,03/21/2017,Cac4000,I just listened to this episode. So different than the regular stories you hear on the news. Please keep them coming!,4
Did it again,03/21/2017,KaylaJay29,"Really interesting look at police videos and the stories behind them. Perspectives that hopefully we can all learn from. Kelly McEvers and the NPR team are doing well on this one, up there with the great work from season one.",5
Manipulative,03/22/2017,Chaz Devine,"First season was good, second season has been, so far, biased and manipulative with information",1
Exceptional podcast,03/22/2017,JaysonMontgomery,"Today, I played first episode of this podcast on my stereo for background noise while I cleaned the house. Halfway through the first episode, I grabbed my headphones to listen more closely. Hours later, I had listened to every episode and cleaned way more of my house than I intended to clean.",5
Intense,03/24/2017,Small Town Boy,"Intense, insightful and not for the faint of heart.",5
Pretty good,03/24/2017,EmilyHouston,I've enjoyed this so far. It's a variety of stories about a variety of people.,4
Thought provoking,03/26/2017,23dj,Excellent and interesting.,5
What an experience!,03/27/2017,Jellyfood,Honestly one of the most thought provoking and through podcasts I've ever listened too. A large range of topics for a pretty young podcast.,5
NPR usual,03/28/2017,yentle the nimble,Super interesting. Easy to listen to. Thought provoking.,5

Gripping Stories,03/29/2017,eRobyn,"Why lie? When I found out this season was going to be about police shootings, I almost unsubscribed. But I gave it a chance and the stories are amazing, high quality, well produced. I don't expect less from NPR, but this podcast really goes above and beyond.",5

worth the listening,03/03/2017,k.hooper,"I really like the concept of this podcast, as the reporter goes ""deep"" into a story and sheds light on it. The best episode that I have listened to so far is the one about closing public schools in Pennsylvania. Wow.",5

Well done,03/05/2017,DonkeyPunch777,I have a voice crush on Kelly;),5
Do it,03/07/2017,gclass,Awesome podcast.,5
Embedded,03/09/2017,WokeListener,"Stories are told with honesty and an honest perspective from the teams working on them. The producers/hosts aren't so focused on being ""perfect"" that they lose a sense of human connection and interaction when covering so many different subjects. Seems like they try to be as well rounded on perspectives on these subjects as possible.",5
Good not Great,03/09/2017,Sounds better then the reviews said,"While it started off promising and I generally like the stories they go into, they don't really ""embed"" themselves into the stories. Most of what they come up with could be read in almost any news article...",4
Pretty dope so far,03/10/2017,Jmall42,It's good,5
Intriguing,03/12/2017,JackiKRN,"Stories are looked at from variable sides. Sheds light onto the good, the bad & the ugly. This podcast does not solve the problems of of the world. Great listen...",4

Intro to a Topic,03/14/2017,Danijay123456,"It feels more like an intro to a situation happening then in depth reporting. I find it enjoyable, 4 episodes in and I can't stop listening. If you are a fan of serial you will most likely enjoy this podcast.",5
Can be great,03/15/2017,Newageofreason81,"The Charlotte episode was the most bias, racist one yet. Most have been very good. However this is NPR so you know it's hard left leaning. Season 1 was great, horrible start on season 2",3

Great show,11/22/2016,Nat Huelsing,NPR has the best variety of podcasts. The very nature of embedded doesn't allow for more episodes but I'm a huge fan and can't wait to see what's next. These journalists truly care about their craft and the subjects they report on.,5
Incredible.,11/24/2016,D Prinster,Incredible. Thoughtful. Thorough. All I could ask for and more for learning about genuine stories that really matter.,5
A Must Listen!,11/28/2016,TheresaVoy,Kelly and her team are nothing but incredible. It's a combination of sitting in a deep dive sociology class to being inside the head of an addict in Indiana. I'm looking forward to many more episodes of this one.,5

facertron,10/02/2016,Facertron,"NPR has expert storytelling and this podcasts does not disappoint. The topics are tough to hear about but I enjoy how this podcast is bringing issues to surface. Many don't even know about these issues because they are never exposed to them. Very imformative and captivating podcast. Also, excellent podcast voices. This is great!",5
More please! :),10/21/2016,MeredithRealtor,I really enjoy this show although the stories can be heart wrenching.,5
Yup this podcast is a keeper,10/22/2016,Freeskier55,"Kelly does an amazing job with this podcast! Engaging, thoughtful and to the point!",5
Really great podcast.,10/24/2016,Moeandmaeandlou,"So engaging! A few episodes were not as interesting as others, but all around very good!",4
Listener,10/28/2016,MDM1745,Excellent podcast with well told stories,5
A testament to good journalism,08/14/2016,cbarr92,The act of taking a national story and turning it into a local story is very necessary. You take the people and their issues into your heart and sympathize in ways you never knew you could. A headline becomes a real person instead of a few bolded words. This podcast is one of my absolute favorites and is very much what all my journalism professors in college hoped to teach us about good journalism.,5
Has the feel of Serial,08/14/2016,viaixtapa,"... without the long term commitment required to follow a story. Very engrossing pieces. Critics who say there's no real depth may be expecting too much from a one-episode podcast. I found I got a lot of insight from, for example, The House. Keep up the good work.",5
When is it coming back??????,08/16/2016,Amylovespods,I love this show can't wait for next season!!,5

How did i miss this for so long!?!,08/21/2016,petersphilo,"This is very high quality long-form journalism (thank goodness someone is still doing it!)..
It reminds me of some of the This American Life pure journalism pieces (like the Harper High School pieces or The Problem We All Live With pieces)..",5
The Real Stuff,08/22/2016,Tedy14624,You can refresh reinforce your understanding of reality very efficiently in an entertaining way,5
Great podcast but what happened??,08/22/2016,Xxttp,Loved the stories so far but how come the episodes have stopped? Would be great to get regular podcasts coming back or at least an announcement as to what happened.,4
Great podcast!,08/23/2016,Chimpface11,"Sort of like ""this American life"" meets the nightly news.",5
Great concept and podcast - more are needed!,08/24/2016,poodlelou,Love the long term/long form podcast production. One can immerse into the story's plot line environment. You left me wanting MORE episodes! Hope you can continue production!,5
Amazing stories,08/26/2016,Bigsquid66,A great view of stories,5

A new favorite,08/28/2016,Wordlover74,"I'm really enjoying this new podcast. While at times I wish the stories would go deeper, or embed longer, I love the personal, story-driven style. This podcast has become a favorite in a very short time.",5
Love this podcast,08/30/2016,Bpeterson92,Great concept and interesting stories. Can't wait for more!,5
As good as it gets,08/30/2016,A listener in Colorado,"Welcome to the future of journalism and radio. Here it is. Exceptionally well researched and presented. More and more, please.",5

Just plain love it,09/01/2016,Hippatt,I love to know the deeper story. I love this podcast and am so thankful that talented people are interested in creating podcasts like this. Can't wait for season two!!,5
I love you Kelly McEvers,09/01/2016,Matt1906,"More episodes, please! What an amazing concept and great execution.",5
Great and riveting.,09/02/2016,Dianaron,"The stories are interesting, eye opening, and gripping. I wish some episodes were longer and more in depth, but I enjoy them and learn a little more.",5
Wonderful and gripping,07/20/2016,Kw777333999111,"I love the stories they're covering, I'm hanging on each new episode! Can't wait for more. Can't believe the negative reviews people are leaving; it's way easier to criticize someone's work on the Internet than to actually DO some work.....",5
Best yet,07/20/2016,djadamjay,"I listen to a lot of thoughtful podcasts and this one is certainly the best. It does exactly what it purports to do; it digs deeper. I love the nuance and the in depth reporting. This podcasts makes the stories that get a couple minutes on national news more human, more connected, and more rich.",5
Awesome!,07/23/2016,Rekellerwu,I love embedded. The stories are in-depth and capture the heart of the humanity.,5
Love how in depth it goes!,07/24/2016,bo84015,"I love how in depth the stories go, and how they present the human side. I'm definitely addicted to this podcast and can't wait for season 2!",5
Great storytelling,07/24/2016,JoeOneTime,"Embedded takes interesting stories and puts a unique and personal take to them. The content is interesting, the interviews engaging, and the diverse range of topics have never failed to pique my interest. Looking forward to more episodes!",5
The Hospital,07/24/2016,rabbithutch,"Excellent. Always wanted to know the day to day of how MFS docs operate in the field. The intensity of the experience is common to people operating on the ""front line"" of anything, hospital ERs, war, disasters. It's hard to exist in these situations for long. Great story. Make more program like this. Thank you.",5
Totally engrossing and important.,07/25/2016,hardcorecelloman,Just finished listening to the first season of Embedded and was blown away by the depth of the storytelling. Really phenomenal reporting NPR. You are a national treasure.,5
Wonderful,07/27/2016,JackTheMack99,"Thanks for the thought-provoking, insightful podcast",5
"Really good, in-depth work ..",07/27/2016,junlei li,I can tell these stories take a lot of work ... and I appreciate hearing the process of getting a story as much as the story. Love the cast.,5
Mr,07/28/2016,Minnesota Joel,Great story telling. Thoroughly enjoyed each episode and am looking forward to the next season.,5
Best new podcast of the year!,07/29/2016,Mindy K.,This is journalism at its finest. I feel like I've been right there with this excellent team as we learn more about the realities of others far and near. Well done!!!,5
amazing,08/03/2016,the_tides,"Completely captivating. The depth and breadth of their reporing is amazing. Like Serial, but a new story each week.",5
"Good, could be great.",08/05/2016,LoveisintheStars,The concept of Embedded is to do a deep dive into a subject; ideally it might be the antidote to the 24-hour news cycle where the format doesn't allow investigative journalism. I liked the first season for the most part but they really only give one side to each story. It would be nice if they could expand the episode runtime and really produce a nuanced look at each subject.,4
If Lisa Ling made a podcast,08/05/2016,Kristaleighbird,"This podcast reminds me of ""My America"" by Lisa Ling, only a podcast instead of a TV show. They try to go into the lives of their subjects instead of speculating from afar. I love how I can ""see"" what's going on through her storytelling style & use of real time background noise. I especially loved the biker episode!",5
"Really, Really Good!",08/06/2016,Lanster81,"I love this podcast! Really riveting and courageous journalism! I love how the producers are personally invested in the stories. Breaks some rules, but that is what makes it great! More episodes please!",5
Embedded,08/08/2016,Trgt6,"Intense, riveting, and relevant",5
Obsessed,08/08/2016,Mmmmmmm8642147,My only wish is that the episodes were longer! Wonderful reporting,5
Love this Podcast,08/09/2016,Watchathink,"I just discovered this podcast maybe a week ago, and I absolutely love the narrator, and the shows that have been produced thus far. Keep up the great work!!!!!!",5
Off to a great start!,08/12/2016,Mercury316,"I really enjoyed the first season. Admittedly I thought a couple of the episodes were boring and didn't give me much to walk away with, but a few I walked away from feeling profoundly affected, namely The Hospital which takes place in South Sudan. That one really stuck with me for days. I even went to the website to read the full story and to look at the pictures. Another one of my favorites was The School, which takes place in Wilkinsburg Pa, just minutes from my house. Listening to all the local kids and teachers, and the fact that the reporters were here for one of the worst shootings we've had, was chilling to listen to, but I was also able to gain some inside perspective. Overall I really enjoyed it and have been talking to other people about it. I'm very excited for season 2.",5
Love Embed!,08/13/2016,Erikaseattle,I love most of these stories! And you can tell they spend a ton of time on this - so impressive. I listen to every single one!,5
"Gripping, polished",07/07/2016,JakesterPDX,"Fascinating stories, told very well. Highly recommended!",5
One of my faves,07/07/2016,CRExpat,"Love this podcast. Illuminating, moving, entertaining stories. Keep up the great work, it is appreciated!!",5
As promised,07/08/2016,SarahNY,"As promised, this podcast features deep dives into current events. Instead of relying on statistics and spokesperson quotes, the Embedded team gets personal with the people at the heart of the story.",5
Great start,07/10/2016,Barberjoshua,I enjoyed the first several episodes but they seemed to have lost momentum and depth. I can only hope they look back at the first two episodes and get back on track.,3
So good!,07/12/2016,madmadmad!,"Like a blend of All Things Considered, Serial, and This American Life. You'll love it!",5
Embedded seeks to find truth,07/12/2016,NPRequalsLIFE,"This is journalism. In our culture today, it is this kind of thorough, in-depth investigative journalism that takes second financial fiddle to more click-baity or popular interest articles. Kelly McEvers is not only a superb journalist, but an emotional and articulate one to boot. We need more Kellys in this world to convince people that weighty, grave stories can be interesting and resonate emotionally, too. Life is made up of not-so-pleasant stories -- we need to take the rose-colored glasses off and acknowledge and appreciate both the greatest highs and the lowest lows of people we don't fully know or understand. We need someone to help break us out of our own bubble; the task of journalism is to reflect life back to us as truthfully as humanly possible. My opinion is that Embedded does a great job of just that.",5
Great insights and view into the journalistic process,07/12/2016,BuyOnEmusic,Gripping and affecting stuff.,5
Embedded,07/13/2016,KWhit1234123,"I really enjoy this podcast! It takes those little stories that you want to get more in-depth info about, or things you would want to know more about, and it turns you on to it. I love them all.",5
Sad that it wasn't better researched... Lacking substance.,07/14/2016,hlynncamacho,"The episodes don't dig deep into the topic, they just talk about them superficially. This definitely isn't investigative journalism and doesn't really captivate me because the information that's shared isn't anything new. It tells a person's story but lacks research to help listeners gain a better understanding of what lead up to that particular situation. You have great interviewees sharing their experiences but you're missing out on engaging your listeners with research.",1
Fantastic and Real,07/14/2016,Jojo525252,This is a great podcast that address the daily lives of people who are impacted by their environment and are open about the good/bad. Highly recommend if you like hearing from the subjects themselves!,5
Love it!,07/16/2016,Hshdje,"Such an interesting podcast
Really hope a new episode is put out soon",5

"Started off strong, following shows don't measure up",07/16/2016,Dilligaff82,"It's like lower quality This American Life, but shorter and with more (quantity and quality) annoying advertisements.",2
Sometimes heavy but always thought provoking,07/16/2016,Brad from Columbia,"I commute 80 miles a day by automobile and I like listening to stories and ideas that stretch my thinking and challenge the norm a bit. I find embedded to be a bit heavy at times but am reminded that the topics covered represent the reality of life both good and bad. The team's approach isn't heavy handed or seeking sensational stories, they are just not afraid to dig into tough topics / situations and try to tell it like it is. Keep up the great work Kelly and crew.",5
Would have gave 5 stars,07/16/2016,T momey,But not consistent - get podcasts every so often... should be weekly,4
One of my favorites!,07/18/2016,Taylor_elizabth,I look forward to every new episode. I love the idea of getting the inside info into things that you would usually never hear about. My favorite is the drug house full of Opana users!,5
My favorite podcast!,07/18/2016,Rajchi,Excellent podcast! Depth with focus on the person. Can't wait for the 2nd season!!!,5
Let's go deeper,07/18/2016,Hisnightingale,"I LOVE this podcast. Great narration, great stories. I love to go a little deeper into the culture and the area. I loved getting to know Joy and learn about suicide rates in the Arctic. Keep up the great work!",5
Deeper than the news -- great fruits of newsgathering.,07/19/2016,Joebackward1,"Sometimes, in my snarkier moods, I mutter to myself accusing the NPR staff of sitting around the studio watching C-SPAN to come up with material for their stories. ""Can't you do anything besides tell us the insults traded by members of the legislature?"" I think.",5
LOVE this!!!,07/20/2016,jfiser22,"Please, please come out with more episodes!!!!",5
Can't wait until next season!,06/28/2016,scwhite123,"I enjoyed Kelly taking a deeper look at stories off the beaten path. In this nanosecond news cycle, it is refreshing to hear more information about a story, especially from people on the front lines of suicide, addiction, immigration, and more. Can't wait to hear more next season!",5
"Interesting topics, great reporting",06/29/2016,Louise Criag,A favorite of mine.,5
Digging deeper,06/29/2016,Umma beast,"Way to go! I am thoroughly enjoying your podcast and excellent journalism. You're helping us get to know more on a story, topic or issue. Keep up the great work!",5
Fantastic reporting from a great reporter,06/30/2016,Syg205,"Adding to my previous review as I continue to listen to more episodes. I'd love to get a deeper look at domestic oil and gas production. We know the global impact - on power, money and politics - but what about the U.S. communities and environment that domestic production affects?",5
Woah,06/30/2016,Stopsendingmenotifications,"Sometime there is not very much depth and a lot of sensationalism, but this is THE best in depth news source that I can find anywhere. No news network provides such a service, even though it is so important to help people generate a well informed opnion based on facts and evidence.",5
Excellent,07/01/2016,luckster17,The reporting is great. Love hearing in depth stories that would normally just be skimming over the surface. Well worth a listen.,5
Thoughtful and personal in-depth look at news today,07/01/2016,DBUOI15,Embedded is able to deliver deeply personal and intensive looks into news stories not always found on the front page. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a break from the '24 hour news cycle' style of TV news.,5

"Extended NPR news stories, not revolutionary",07/01/2016,westontt,"I enjoy Embedded, especially as a a longer-form approach to the types of stories you hear about on NPR news shows. There's a touch of the modern storytelling mania here, but modestly so.",4
Can't wait for next season,07/01/2016,Camgue,This show got into areas and showed a new perspective or known quantity in humanity. Regardless of your view there's a lot to learn about humanity from this podcast.,5

Enlightening!,07/03/2016,2-1=grate,"Enlightening podcast. I don't always love the subjects they choose, (i.e. things not actually newsworthy, like sports players who can't get jobs, no real news, no social injustice). But the reporting is always non-political and really great.",5

Audio tourism - could be better,07/06/2016,antonycpr,"I love some parts of Embedded and I find some parts very frustrating. I guess it‚Äôs all about taking the listener ‚Äúthere‚Äù right into a situation. The reporter/presenters seem very sympathetic and expressive. But is it enough to just go somewhere and record what‚Äôs happening? Sometimes it works. The Police, The Immigrant, The School, are all great episodes that gave me some more insight into people and places I have never been. But The Bikers, The Capital, and most of all The Arctic, started to seem like like edgy recording projects as tourism. Why we‚Äôre they there? What did we learn? Early in the Arctic episode we hear - ‚ÄúIn the arctic young people are killing themselves. To find out why, Rebecca Hersher went to Greenland for 3 months in the winter.‚Äù Well, all credit due to Rebecca for spending 3 months up there. But did we find out why this is happening? I certainly wanted to know. It seems like it‚Äôs an important thing to try to understand. I never heard an explanation. I heard Rebecca describing how she felt. The last 5 minutes or so was all about how it was affecting her, how she felt overwhelmed. (cue Molly Worthen‚Äôs op-ed piece in the New York Times - Stop Saying ‚ÄòI Feel Like‚Äô 4.30.2016) She ends with ‚ÄúI do it because it feels really exciting. And because once you start to realize there‚Äôs a whole world of people to worry about, it‚Äôs kind of hard to not go meet them all‚Äù. But what about those people? What about them?",2
Another great NPR podcast,07/06/2016,JackFunk21,"If you like Serial, you'll enjoy Embedded. Well-done, and well-hosted. Have enjoyed each episode.",5
"Like it , but why is there a pause recently",07/07/2016,Dian Z.,Can anyone tell me why it stops updating since June 11? Want it back so bad!,5
AMAZING. OBSESSED with this podcast,06/16/2016,v_angelova,"Great and detailed reporting on issues that we usually skim through. The El Salvador, the MSF and the one on opioid abuse brought me to tears. I discovered it yesterday, and have already listened to 6 episodes. Keep up the great work!",5
"Interesting, compelling",06/17/2016,BHA1411,I've really enjoyed the entire season of Embedded - every episode is a great story and examination of an issue (or several) affecting us today. I hope this continues and returns for a season 2!,5
Awe inspiring podcast,06/18/2016,lissieluxo,"This tackle tough topics and does it beautifully. They really do ""dig deep"" on the headlines and bring a new dimension to news stories. I absolutely loved their story on the d league basketball teams and I'm not even a sports fan. Easily one of my favorite podcasts out there.",5
Discomfort Zone,06/18/2016,Triall,"Topics that are tackled are not easy ones to face but we grow by either experiencing or learning through the experiences of others. Some shows are about something that hits close to home such as suicide (even if I don't live in Greenland) and are relatable to me, after which I don't feel alone in my suffering anymore. Other topics covered such as what it's like to be a hopeful NBA player open my eyes (ears) to a whole other world that I wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to know about. Each eposiode brings an element of discomfort and that is because learning and growing is rarely easy or pleasant but always worth it. Thanks McEvers & team!",5
"great concept, well executed",06/19/2016,Thezena,"you've done a great job of humanizing news stories and inviting listeners in to the real lives embedded in a ""news event"". Thanks for the spotlight. Hope and change can come from that.",5
Great podcast,06/20/2016,Ginuser,I look forward to each new episode. I love the way each story is told from all perspectives. Honest and genuine. Highly recommend!,1
Great storytelling. Hot topics. Favorite new podcast,06/20/2016,Sebaz88,I like hearing news but I always feel I needed more on certain news. This podcast hits that spot.,5
Really enjoyed!,06/21/2016,Tigger1158,"I'm new listening to podcasts! I usually look at the ratings and then listen to the first one. Then I go from there and decide if I'm going to subscribe.

For other listeners, listen and you will not be disappointed!",5
Hit and Miss,06/21/2016,LyaRQ,"Some episodes are interesting, but others are kind of pointless. The worst episodes don't really provide much information or an interesting story. Hoping season two will be better.",3
Fascinating and emotionally engaging,06/21/2016,KABergeron,I love Embedded. It is a fascinating look at stories that I never thought to look twice at. It gives you insight into the deeper issues at the heart of the headlines.,5

Well-Done,06/25/2016,Nazzy06,"Discovered the series upon hearing an MSF/DWB portrait of a hospital in South Sudan. Poignant, haunting, and beautifully portrayed.",5
Can't stop listening,06/26/2016,Sobriquet31,Listened to the skid row episode and then decided to go back and listened to the show from the beginning and now I've spent the whole afternoon listening to the whole first season and I want MOAR! <3,5
Life. Changed.,06/26/2016,AmylovesCharlie,"Everyday, as I walk my dog, I listen to podcasts. Sometimes I'm in a silly mood. Other days, political, and sometimes I'm not sure what I want. But when there's a new Embedded in my feed, I know that that will be the next podcast for me.",5
Embedded,06/27/2016,Half-fast Mantis,"I love Kelly McEvers' work on NPR and am so happy she's now co-hosting ATC. And the idea behind this show is great. But the depth and emotion they want just isn't there. Frankly, I feel more moved when I listen to many a 4-minute NPR features than I do spending 20 minutes in the Sudan with ""Embedded."" I think one reason is, that 4-minute feature has a clear focus, a point they want to get across. The point I hear getting across in these episodes is too diffuse:""Life is hard."" Even though they have lots of time, they never develop one character very fully, preferring breadth to depth. And Kelly's vocal phrasing is heavily put upon here and artificial. After every sentence, we know we are supposed to think, ""Wow, that's really heavy."" It gets old. All in all, maybe doing one episode a week on a different topic like this is too much. It sounds like the crew parachutes in, rather than really embeds itself into a place or subculture. I really hope NPR figures out this podcast thing; they have a lot of talent, but maybe they are looking at this new medium in too superficial a way to conquer it.",3
Great episode,06/28/2016,Rrssthbokvar,I've honestly become pretty obsessed with embedded. This was the first episode that I listened to and then I felt bad about not leaving a review after having listened to all of them. This series is sooooo good. Every single episode has me hanging on the edge of my seat. This one specifically was very good but I love this series and can't wait to see what comes next! By far the best podcast series I have listened to.,5
Perspective,06/28/2016,Gaby12345678,These topics are all very interesting. Glad this podcast has an open minded perspective. They seek truth/realities on a global scale. Gives validity to voices that are often silenced. <3,5
Excellent show!,06/13/2016,Sstewart7214,Great show! Love the last podcast about school closings!,5
Deeper Digging,06/13/2016,Tazemebro,I think Embedded offers an interesting and more thorough look at some stories. I have been engaged in some episodes more than others but all have been a good listen.,5
Terrible,06/14/2016,Kj440,Liked this podcast until the latest school episode one. Couldn't even get through the whole thing with them spewing their media bs. Maybe they're shutting down the schools because they're not producing educated individuals not because they're black.,1
Amazing,06/14/2016,TaraJeanRay,I'm always looking for podcasts that challenge me to think outside of the world I know and experience daily. Embedded does just that. It's not often I jump online to see more about the story told or research people and places mentioned in an episode. I'm thankful I found this gem and encourage you to listen.,5
Love this Podcast and Kelly McEvers!,06/14/2016,Funny & Addicting,I love this podcast. I have a mini crush on Kelly McEvers so I was so excited when I heard she was going to be hosting a podcast. This one has made me laugh and cry and I'm always so excited for it to pop up in my podcast feed. Keep up the good work!,5
"Wonderfully insightful, addictive and heart wrenching",06/14/2016,Jules085456127258,"My husband and I binged Embedded episodes on a cross country road trip and couldn't believe the depth and rich narrative of the stories.

Disappointed,06/15/2016,Melebeus,"The concept, based on the title and description, is the show goes ""deep"" into a story. They are embedded. However, this does not really happen. The pick, which the tell you, a single individual, a sympathetic character they can use to establish a one sided sympathetic view of the situation. The show is not about the story or situation, it's about this one chosen person.",3
"Embeded:Awarnes, Motivation, Emotion",06/15/2016,Cooper Lajeunesse,"This podcast is the absolute best collection of stories I have ever found. I am a student, currently in 12th grade, and this podcast provides awarnes, motivation and emotion (I've cried multipule times while listening) to a very confusing world in which we live.

Please come back Embedded,06/16/2016,BuyNothing,Either these reporters LOVE this kind of in-depth reporting or NPR is throwing a ton of money at them. And I'm going to guess that it's the reporters. Such interesting stories and great perspectives. Thank you to the very real and very compelling host Kelly McEvers and the Embedded team. Please come back,5

Very Good Reporting,06/16/2016,Nutzfor341,"One of the many reasons why NPR reporters are so well respected in the field. This Podcast brings it home! Real domestic concerns scene thought the lens of a seasoned foreign correspondent. Give a listen, doubtful you'll be disappointed",5

Excellent-So Much Better Than I Though,06/16/2016,Ryan-Patrick,"I was looking forward to the launch of Embedded but the description of the episodes didn't appeal. Finally, o listened to a full episode and was hooked. Kelly McEvers is the best!",5
Enjoyable despite depressing topics,06/09/2016,Chelebell99,"I enjoy Embedded. It follows stories in a very insightful manner. The topics aren't what one would consider pleasant, but we can't ignore the unpleasantries of the world so that doesn't bother me at all.",5
Amazing!,06/09/2016,annodo11,"I love love love love love this podcast! I appreciate the frank and very human representation of the issues, giving one a more wholistic view of the topic. I wait eagerly every week for the next episode. 10/10, would recommend.",5

Very Good Podcast,06/09/2016,Wilmettegirl,The concept behind Embedded is great. These days all the news you get is headlines and tag lines. This podcast tells very good stories. I have been happy and crying within the same podcast. They're doing a great job!,5
Excellent podcast.,06/10/2016,TheAmazon1,"This is a thoughtful and well done podcast about important things happening right now. The only complaint I have is that the episodes are too short. I think this podcast could really benefit from a bit more time allotted for each episode, to really dig in there, you know?",4
Greenland Episode,06/11/2016,Atater06,"I usually really enjoy your in-depth stories, but the Greenland story seemed to be more about the reporter and her anquish then the actual subjects of the story. Overall, the production and topic were great but the focus on the reporter's worry and angst was overplayed. Thanks again for covering this important story.",4
Really digging it!,06/11/2016,NateInMT,Great job! This is quickly becoming a favorite podcast. Keep it up.,5
Excellent,06/11/2016,flight controller 101,Quickly became my favorite podcast.,5

Wonderful connection,06/12/2016,mha49,"I'm a true fan! The topics are ""all over the map"" and explored truthfully and without varnish. After each story I feel better connected with this world.",5
"Good stories, not that deep",06/12/2016,peoign;owanwg,"There are some interesting stories here, but they rarely go as deep as I expect them to.",3
Occasionally condescending host,06/12/2016,feliciaalingu,The host's commentary and some questions she asks to the subjects are demonstrative of her glaring privilege and cringeworthy at times...,2
Eye opening,06/12/2016,Sassy2u15,I deeply enjoy all the episodes. They keep me up to date with issues and develop compassion for the people in each episode.,5
Embedded,06/12/2016,HinChico,Worthwhile podcast. Thank you Kelly and cohorts.,5
Excellent podcast,06/13/2016,JessWW,"Interesting, entertaining, and well-paced storytelling. I look forward to each episode.",5
The Human Experience,06/13/2016,StellaLuna in Tucson,"I've really enjoyed this podcast. I feel as though I am sitting with the narrators and with the people who are being interviewed as they navigate their circumstances. With two episodes from the first season, I was listening while running on my jogging route -- and crying at the same time (once from joy, once from sadness). I am reminded that these are ordinary people, but nothing is more extraordinary than life.",5
100% awesome,06/13/2016,Ptszenchantress,"LOVE LOVE this podcast. Great reporting, great reporters. I enjoy that they do follow ups on episodes. So looking forward to the next season!",5

Love this podcast!,06/13/2016,LoriLynB,I was so sad to find out The School was the last episode of the season because I loved the podcast so much! I found it to be so interesting and I'll be looking forward to the next season!,5

In Another's Shoes,06/05/2016,Crissy23846,"I mainly listen to my podcasts at work. Most block out other conversations, but Embedded often stops me in my tracks and has, on occasion, brought tears to my eyes. It truly gets to the heart of the story.",4
My new favorite podcast,06/06/2016,Bellelover,Love everything about this podcast. I like how they focus on different topics each week. The reporting is great and I have been raving to my friends and family about how they need to listen as well!,5
Finally said goodbye,06/06/2016,skihigh2002,"I stuck with the podcast for the first half dozen episodes. I thought maybe they would find stories that didn't wallow in the misery of others. Nope. I'm not saying I want a ""feel good story"" every week but come'on, a little levity wouldn't hurt. Also, the ads are incredibly annoying. ""We love great stories"" makes me want to go out of my way to not purchase your product. Painful and pandering.",2
disappointing,06/06/2016,Steven Loy,"I've never written a review, but with this podcast I feel I must warn against the false claims of the show's mkaers. It is touted as ""going deep"" into a story, but after listening to a few episodes, it clearly does no such thing, nor does it presume to. ""Going deep"" implies research, fact checking, multiple interviews with both sides of the story, background, context, efforts at solutions, etc... what people used to call feature reporting. But this show just presents a ""day-in-the-life"" portrait of the situation. Its just not possible to learn the truth about all sides of a story with one day of on-location interviews and reporting. So enjoy this podcast for what it is - superficial one-day fact gathering and character portraits, delivered in teenager-speak and Sarah-Koenig-like narration. But under no definition do the reproters ""go deep"" into a story. And for an NPR production this is a pretty low standard. I'll be sticking with Pro-Publica for stories that ""go deep"".",2
Amazing EMBD,06/06/2016,Fulvio Jr,Incredible piece of journalism.,5

Cogent and sobering. Stays with you long after it ends.,06/07/2016,Adam-Wade,"I workout listening to podcasts and music, late at night. On lifting and intense-cardio days, I listen to upbeat and perky songs or comedy acts. On moderate-cardio days where I walk and jog on the treadmill, I listen to serious podcasts like this one. Being alone in the gym at midnight with no distractions around me, I focus and am transported.",5
New Favorite,06/07/2016,Dudette.yo,I tore through the first 5 episodes. Embedded is an amazing way to get in depth understanding on what otherwise would have been a fleeting print news article. Keep it coming!,5

Kelly does an amazing job of narrating these stories, painting the picture in my mind as I sit here in my beige colored cubicle of war torn Sudan or a drug den in Indiana. I'm so excited to keep listening. I will admit that I'm a binge listener, I can't wait too long though!",5
Thought-provoking Journalism,06/03/2016,StayCtruebeats,"I started listening to Embedded from the beginning, and it's easily been one of the most interesting, raw examples of journalism I've ever been exposed to, certainly within ten podcast realm.

Wish it was longer,06/04/2016,Pleasantly Pleased 1,"I know, that's easy for me to say when I don't really know what goes into putting these episodes together. I am enjoying these episodes, very informative and though provoking. I do feel like a couple times we're just getting started and then the episode has to end.

Great new in detailed look at issues,06/04/2016,Patch Lee,"While each episode is very different in topic, the storytelling style is similar between each episode.

Makes Thursday commutes RIVETING!!,06/04/2016,tommieperrins,"Love this podcast!! So so interesting, the hospital episode was truly heartbreaking! Really great reporting!

I've easily listened to 50 different podcasts and multiple episodes of each. Embedded is in my top three. Each week they choose a subject that you might not expect to be interested in but they present it such a way that makes you wonder why you haven't bern curious about it before. Kelly McEvers, the host, has a pleasant voice and helps bring the stories to life. If you listen to many podcasts, you will appreciate the producer who makes sure that all voice levels are equal. You don't have to turn up the volume for one person and down for another. I look forward every week to a new episode. Thank you!!",5

Amazing,05/27/2016,Macisar,"This podcast gives more than just the ""news story"" of an event that happens. Kelly really goes in to find the small details.

More than Shoot and Run,05/27/2016,Chris P3,"When most of our TV and radio stories are 45 to 90 seconds long, it's refreshing to get more in depth.

Insightful and beautifully told stories,05/28/2016,Bbisous,"So often you hear a news story in isolation, the talking points divulged and then the next story starts.

Wow! So insightful! Look forward the Thursday,05/26/2016,Ipajeau,I LOVE the Embedded podcast. It gets you up close and personal with people in different situations and helps you see the triumph and tragedy. I look forward to it every week.,5
My New Favorite Podcast!,05/26/2016,mackenzieadermn,I can't begin to say enough great things about this podcast. Kelly McEvers does a fantastic job of taking listeners inside lesser know news stories and giving you humanistic perspective into each week's topic. After each episode I'm left thinking it is the best episode so far and the next week's episode is even better. The combination of Embedded's powerful reporting and flawless storytelling make it one of the best podcast's around!,5
Love it!,05/26/2016,P2tch3r,Great in depth reporting.,5
"Compelling storytelling, really grabs you",05/26/2016,ErinTangerine,"Amazing storytelling. I love this podcast. It really grabs your attention and moves you, sometimes with human drama, other times with humor. I've walked way past my destination because I was so engrossed by this podcast. I'm so glad it exists. I was moved to donate to Doctors Without Borders after the ""Hospital"" episode. Thank you for making this incredible thing. It cannot be easy!",5
Accurate and gripping,05/26/2016,Pet-Rock,"Embedded really has done an amazing job. In a world filled with sound bites they provide instructive in depth but easily digestible looks at varied stories about life and people. As a doctor who has had the privilege to work internationally with children in places where there is great need the episode about the MSF hospital was incredibly tangible, reminiscent and transporting. I look forward to more Embedded stories.",5
"Keep em coming, and thanks",05/26/2016,FPD 8_2,"Each podcast has either stirred my emotions or forced me to critically think about the story.
Keep it up.",5
"Gripping, Real, Emotional",05/26/2016,Sharkemperor,I have never written a review of a podcast but I just had to dive in after the latest episode of Embedded. This podcast is like an audio documentary every week. Kelly McEvers is not only reporting on the stories but has become part of them as the name of the show implies. The emotion she brings to every episode makes the stories come alive and inspires emotion in the listeners. Keep up the good work.,5
Really good,05/26/2016,Kate1323,"I really like this podcast. Some of the topics are more interesting than others, but I definitely always enjoy listening to Kelly tell the stories. Sometimes I feel like it's a little bit too short. They end it and I feel like they could have gone a little bit farther with it but I think they are just trying to get these issues on people's minds to start a discussion. One of my friends and I listen to this and then come together and discuss the issue that week, and while we may not always agree on the issue Kelly presents it always leads to a great conversation and debate on the topic. I would definitely recommend this podcast!!",5
Fantastic!,05/27/2016,amishaofficialx,"This podcast is amazing. The reporting is informational and personal. I have laughed and I have cried while listening to this podcast. There's not even a specific type of person that would like this, I think everyone will!",5

Big Letdown,05/23/2016,Good at first and then...,"I was so excited to check this podcast out after listening to the previews on other NPR products. Turns out, the show is actually pretty boring.",3
New Media Evangelist,05/24/2016,LoudChristian,There is so much power in the stories you present. Just listened to We Found Joy and as a person who has felt with addiction issues I found the piece uplifting and at the same time very real to the struggle. I Pray for Joy and her family as they continue through their journey to freedom. Thank you for putting such a human face on what is often reported as a statistic.,5
AMAZING,05/25/2016,DGulbas,"I thought Serial and This American Life were the best podcast out there, and this surpasses my obsession. I‚Äôm a journalism major, former newspaper photographer, and I think it‚Äôs great journalism.",5
New favorite podcast,05/25/2016,Sprex2,"Very interesting, thought provoking stories. Warning: you may get addicted to this podcast.",5
Keep going!,05/25/2016,candyynz,"Sad to see the negative reviews on here. Yes, may not seem like reporting but really, who else is going to go out there and draw attention to the issues that the media is ignoring? There was some questions that can come off as insensitive but I don't believe Kelly McEvers would be sacrificing her time and putting herself in danger to go out there and insult people. She really wants to know what causes the problems so that we can therefore draw our own conclusion from it.",5
Enthralling!,05/26/2016,KRM222,"This podcast is wonderful! Even stories I don't think I'll be interested in, like the basketball one, they grab you, and make the story important to you, and you cannot wait to hear what happens. I love the variety of topics, and the depth they go into. It's a great listen. Download it now! You'll love it, I'm certain!",5
So good,05/26/2016,bossgirl123,Every episode is so engrossing and well produced. Even the ones I'm not initially interested in always sucked in. Keep it up npr!,5

Outstanding journalism,05/26/2016,Jack Belapio,"Embedded is one of the best pure journalism podcasts out there. The reporters are blending the old (human interest stories and on the spot reporting) with the new(ish) media of podcasting and they are doing important work. Embedded opens your eyes to the world and makes you feel a deeper connection to stories that feel far away-especially in the MSF episode from South Sudan. If you are new to this podcast, listen to that episode first.",5
Thought provoking & entertaining,05/26/2016,MethodicJon,"Always thought-provoking, always entertaining. Sometimes I just wish it was a little bit longer and I could hear more.",5

Great podcast,05/21/2016,Courtp125,Kelly McEvers delievers a great podcast that goes inside some of our nations hot topics. It is fascinating to listen to. I loved the episode where she revisted Joy and I was so happy to hear Joy is doing well. I would love to hear more revisited episodes.,5
Heavy but worth it!,05/21/2016,Pareezy,"I finally got into ""Embedded"" after hearing it advertised on the myriad other podcasts I listen to. And by got into it, I mean I spent the afternoon soaking in the whole back catalog. The stories are immersive and compelling for a 30 min podcast, and the topics are fascinating. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy NPR's story telling style reporting (think maybe Serial in thirty minutes), and there's not always a happy ending.",5
Going to be a great show,05/22/2016,Terroir,"Love the concept, love the stories, great show.",5
Beautiful descriptions,05/23/2016,Los guapos,"Team describes in such detail, you feel like your there.",5
First podcast that made me donate,05/23/2016,theglobalguy,"While there is a little bit of sensational""yuppie reporter discovers the gritty side of life"", type of reporting it's still a very enjoyable way to spend a drive. I actually liked it enough to make a donation to NPR for the first time.",4
Good podcast; short and sweet,05/23/2016,cfalt007,"Serial season 2 was a disappointment for me. Embeded is perfect, not a lot of banter or built in ads instead it's a brief journalistic expose into humanity in America.",5

Amazing,05/23/2016,Spider Cents,One of the best podcasts I've listened to. Deep and engaging and at times heart breaking.,5
Embedded,05/12/2016,Theresad12,Love this podcast can't get enough,5
One of the best non-business podcasts on NPR,05/12/2016,GTheodos,"I am a busy, business owner and don't have time to listen to a lot of podcasts so when I do they are mostly business or news type podcasts. And I usually stay away from social documentary type podcasts as they come across as agenda driven. But this one so far is different. It is well produced, lucid and not stupid. If u have the time to listen to an updated 60 Minutes type broadcast, then I strongly recommend this one.",5
Excellent concept,05/12/2016,alden,This podcast is based on an excellent concept. I love the idea of extra deep dives on diverse topics.,5
Needed this,05/12/2016,Brandileighhh,"Every week has such a captivating, well reported story. I haven't been this excited for a podcast weekly since Serial.",5
"good podcast, not too slanted",05/13/2016,mwalbert,"given the source, i was afraid this podcast would be badly slanted to the left. doesn't seem to be too bad, except for the refusal to use the more appropriate term 'illegal immigrant' on the immigration podcast. pretty interesting podcast, hope it keeps going.",4

Brilliant.,05/15/2016,rmccartney,"I often feel that people who aim to be well-informed simply read headlines, get to know the names in the news, and stop at that.

Very Informative,05/10/2016,RML3wood,"I have enjoyed every episode I have listened to, and found them to be exactly as I think they were intended; a deeper look at the stories covered on NPR.

"Amazing investigative, exploratory journalism stories",05/10/2016,ToneTone541,"Each episode features a unique story relevant to today's most pressing social issues. The embedded approach makes you feel the pain of the opioid addict's withdraw and numbness, the anxiety and despair of the immigrant, and the loyalty and shock of the biker gang member. This podcast series is one of the best. Cannot wait to see where the next episode takes us.",5
Great In-depth Coverage,05/10/2016,Edgar OS,"Although some coverage could be better, the podcast does a great job at exploring big news stories once the media decides to move past them. This is a nice, short podcast with very enlightening episodes.",5

One of the best podcasts!,05/07/2016,Kylemcman,"First off, I'm always excited when there's a new episode posted. This show is maybe one of the most insightful and enlightening podcasts you'll listen to. The depth at which Embedded goes into a story makes it a very unique experience, allowing the listener to almost feel like they are sitting in the room (or car) during the interview. My only complaint would be that I wished they were longer!! This is a must listen!",5
Fantastic news program...,05/07/2016,critterhands,"...from one of the last news organizations still practicing actual journalism.

Won‚Äôt be listening to a second episode,05/07/2016,j356j,"‚ÄòThe House‚Äô episode made me deeply uncomfortable. The host did not seem to be treating the issue with any care or to have worked very hard at reporting it. There were so many questionable judgment calls. Rather than going deep into the story, it was really skimming the surface. I found it to be sensationalistic.",1

Outstanding reporting,05/04/2016,Im sleepless,"They reach the depth and breadth of subject stories professionally. Chris and Kelly have calm, smooth voices that is used in a wide range of situations.

Miss Serial? Listen to this,05/04/2016,GracieRou,"When Serial is on hiatus, I crave the sound of a voice as soothing as Sarah Koenig's. Well, this podcast is the answer to your Serial withdrawal.

Crushing,05/05/2016,California Jonesey,"Just listened to the Capital episode and trying to stop crying. How does Kelly M keep it together? That father who spoke about how he lies to his daughter every night about his day at work, telling her he saw the beautiful beaches and mountains instead of dead bodies, that just killed me, man.

The Immigrant,05/02/2016,Thenewalchemist,"I cannot even begin to express how insanely frustrated I am with the state of our government and social society. This episode is a perfect example of how wrong-headed we have become. At least how wrong ‚Äúthe powers that be‚Äù have been and are. To deport this man to a country he has little if any ties to is totally insane. The result is NOT helping anyone. The result is emotional pain and brokeness on both sides. A destroyed man and emotionally devastated family. It makes me sick, it makes me want to cry, it makes me enraged. And all for what? Because a young confused and lost immigrant smoked a little weed to ease the pain of life? This is the opposite of empathy and compassion, this is hate. The ‚Äúpowers that be‚Äù (that being the judges, prosecutors and corporate entity of CCA) are exercising hate at will for profit. We should all be embarrassed, disgusted and enraged. This is an excellent example of how broken and wrong we have become. Thank you Kelly for your intellect and courage to expose this to the world.",5
Listen to The Uncertain Hour instead,05/02/2016,Patrick Scones,The premise for the show sounds great‚Äîgoing deep on one story--but in practice it reveals itself as more like ‚Äúdrive by‚Äù reporting.,2
Excellent,05/02/2016,Hmdbutler,Informative and entertaining!,5
Great Addition to the Lineup,05/02/2016,Blewdo,Sometimes I find myself needing more podcasts for listening throughout the week and this is a great and entertaining addition!,5
The Capital,05/02/2016,Qvc987,We have been getting more and more students from Central America. They never really talk about the details of why they left. This podcast helped make it real for me. Now I understand a tiny piece of their lives. It is heartbreaking.,5
Fantastic!!!,05/02/2016,monkeyboy7604,Truly riveting and down right disturbing in many cases. I love this podcast.,5
Gripping reporting,05/03/2016,T-Lot,The podcast is great! The stories go very in-depth and they are so interesting to listen to.,5
Awesome investigative Journalism,05/03/2016,Review4U199085,This is one of the best podcasts!!!,5
Excellent coverage on current issues,05/03/2016,Aamul,"I don't review often, I felt compelled to review this podcast. Really enjoy how deep this goes and how it attempts to put a ""human"" spin on the story. It has a touch of left lean, but not so slanted that I think it's only for someone who agrees with politics of a dem. Please keep it up!",5
Awesome,05/03/2016,LCGivens,Love it! I look forward to each episode.,5
Give it a chance! You wont regret it!,04/29/2016,BereDM,"This deep dive narrative of issues that we have all at least heard about is amazing. So glad they are not one hour long, so I can start and finish an episode on my drive home. Just found about it on monday, binge listened to all the episodes and anxiously awaiting for the new one.",5
Gripping stories,04/29/2016,mikeguydude,"This podcast is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The stories are so interesting and it's great to get a look from different perspectives of other people's lives in other areas of the country/world. I'm almost upset that I found this podcast so soon, because I'd love to binge on them.",5
Disappointing,04/29/2016,Metaphorically Inky,"The title led me astray: ‚ÄúEmbedded‚Äù implies insight gained through longer-term involvement in an area or a group. This podcast has some good reporting, and no doubt spending 3-4 days in El Salvador in that particular situation was emotionally impactful for the reporters. But it is not being embedded, nor does the El Salvador or the other episodes offer much more than anyone else‚Äôs reportage. It‚Äôs well-done, but falls far short of what I‚Äôd expect from an Embed. It remains superficial, sadly; the same group, spending more time, would give us much more. Would you trust the judgement of someone who went somewhere, traveled around a few days with a fixer, asked the fixer some questions, and then purported to really know the country or subject? A nice start, but the first thing I‚Äôd fix about this podcast is a title which raises expectations that are not met.",3
Good investigation and reporting. Only needs a finishing line.,04/29/2016,iPaloAltan,"I liked it because he episodes are based on real life stories, well investigated and smoothly reported. I think it just needs a finish line that wraps up the episode and a sentence for future directions. Sometimes the stories just stay up in the air and you are surmised that the episode is over.",5
By far my favorite new podcast,04/29/2016,savagenut,Incredibly well produced and executed podcast.,5
Amazing,04/29/2016,Snorfulus,"This is by far my favorite podcast ever! The in depth analysis of the story covered is beyond captivating. Basically it is everything you loved about Serial, with the intensity of Vice, in 40minutes.",5
Excellent series,04/29/2016,fadecutmike,"Liking Embedded a lot, stories are good and it feels well done. not a fan of the hubspot ads tho..",5

High quality journalism,04/30/2016,Bright green Laurie,This is a great show. I just want the depth to be a bit deeper in a show with this title,4
Thanks for the great reporting!,04/30/2016,Slewit22,Great in depth work. More drug stories please!,5
good start,04/30/2016,sarahbethchi,"i hope that this podcast keeps going because it seems like the team is on their way to creating a great way to pursue investigative reporting. the show is not long enough to really exhaust the material, though. i would like to see more projects like ‚Äúserial‚Äù‚Äî where the reporters are able to dig very deeply and uncover lots of angles on an issue.",4
Another great one from NPR!,04/30/2016,Mtnpr,"I love listening to NPR, and my local radio station bounces between NPR podcasts, TED talks, all things considered, and music - usually all that good stuff happens in the morning and in the evening, so having access to news programs like this whenever is awesome. The reporters are easy to listen to, intelligent, and explore different perspectives and situations within each episode (like good journalists should). These podcasts are very moving and a great way to keep up with current, ongoing issues and conflicts. Thanks NPR, we love you!!",5

Excellent Reporting- great stories!,04/28/2016,ShellWest,I'll keep listening as long as you keep telling great stories!!,5
Depends on what you're looking for,04/28/2016,alien_poet,"Embedded is essentially an All Things Considered piece given about 40 minutes of virtual airtime. Essentially, it allows producers to use all the great audio they have to cut to fit in a regular broadcast segment. There are ups and downs to this.",3
Inspiring,04/28/2016,Thrapston Cheesely,"Every story is thoughtful and complete. It offers insight into issues that we pass off after turning off the news. So human, so sad. My only issue with this podcast is that the episodes could be longer. Amazing none the less.",5
Love it!,04/28/2016,tinmanfoto,I love the way a story is told and really feel educated on what lie beneath. Excellent podcast.,5
Great,04/28/2016,Bjm12,I love this podcast and the host does an amazing job! I would highly recommend this podcast for everyone.,5

Awesome,04/29/2016,Seeg33,Awesome job putting each episode together,5
Brilliant,04/29/2016,Pennydiannaholmes,Love this so much. Great reporting unique inside perspective.,5
Trying so Hard to be Serial,04/29/2016,DPM*Social,Even the description sounds like it's a Serial knockoff. Sigh. NPR you do so many things right. Why do you need to do this?,1
Great podcast,04/29/2016,Shannon Gillespie,Great podcast! Covering interesting subjects. My only complaint is it only comes out once a week.,5

Fascinating,04/29/2016,Donin13,In the first two episodes McEvers explores subcultures that I would never have (or really want) access too. She does it with respect and preserves people's dignity.,5
What audio journalism should be,04/29/2016,PodcastListener7462836,Just listen.,5
This is one of the greatest podcasts ever,04/29/2016,ChicagoHayes8,"This is amazing, thoughtful and fantastic reporting",5
I am addicted to these podcasts!,04/29/2016,Leviconstant,"Amazing stories that really captivate the audience and pulls them right into whats happening. Once I begin an episode I can't turn it off. Kelly is incredibly insightful and poses unique and very thought provoking questions that really require some thought. Her voice is so nice to listen too and I seriously wish all my books on tape could come in her voice! I love her sense of curiosity and the fact that she and her team dive right into all situations-whether it's with gangs in El Salvador, bikers in Texas,or drug users in rural America-she's there getting the real scoop of the story. We seriously need more reporting like this. This is what reporting is and should be about-getting the real story and going to places where the average joe doesn't want to go or reporting on stories and issues that mainstream media wants nothing to do with and tries to cover up. Please keep up with these podcasts! The American public needs you to get the truth out there-no matter what the topic is. Maybe you could do some reporting on touchy political issues/scandals? Or into the drug corporations and their ridiculous amount of pull in the government and outside of it-basically they control america now. Or maybe the food industry and how nutrition deficient and bad for us most of the food out there is? Our country needs to change and I think this podcast has the potential to be a huge catalyst for national change-I mean just look at the effect this had on the whole case with the high school kid who was wrongfully accused of murder! No one would've given his case a second thought if it wasn't for Kelly's reporting!!!",5
Excellent,04/29/2016,Ed McMann,"One of the best new concepts in radio and storytelling I've heard in a long time.
Superior journalism, that manages to be entertaining while educating the listener on a variety of topics related to law, immigration and other news worthy topics.",5
Lumpkin,04/29/2016,Tammy Avery,"I enjoyed the last episode, Immigration, but Caitlin Dickerson's description of Lumpkin County is off and seems to be an attempt to build the story.",4
Time Well Spent,04/29/2016,TobieB,"Heard about this podcast while listening to RadioLab. Downloaded one episode, listened and was hooked. Really appreciate the stories and the unbiased viewpoints (NPR is known for being heavily biased/liberal leaning, but that does not come through in this podcast).",5
Brilliant,04/27/2016,LeScribbler,Completely captivating & brilliant. NPR's new program Embedded takes listeners deep beyond the headlines into the details & voices of the story. Highly recommend.,5

Awesome,04/28/2016,FabulousMari,Insightful in depth reporting,5
Great but too short,04/28/2016,Procax,I really enjoy this new NPR podcast. The stories are engrossing and entertaining but way too short. I want these to be an hour or more. I'm really glad to hear that the show is revisting the people from episode 1. And I hope to hear similar follow ups with the Bikers and Police as well.,5
Great series!,04/28/2016,TampaGunner1,Good topics and well done!,5
Amazing Podcast,04/26/2016,Rileyforpresident,I was immediately engaged in her story telling and how brave she is to embed herself in these situations to try to learn the truth. A must listen. A must subscribe. You won't be disappointed.,5
Strong for a New Podcast,04/26/2016,Embretted,"All the episodes so far (first four episodes) are really well put together, edited, and recorded. The stories are interesting, and it adds something extra when the journalists report on the events from the actual locations where they were/are taking place.",4
Very informative and thought provoking,04/26/2016,Hjhyff,Embedded is a podcast for those who enjoying knowing what really goes on behind these big stories that hit the news for weeks and slowly fade away. This is exceptional journalism and not your average hogwash that you may get from the news or other forms of news that does not care to get the truth from where the action happens.,5
Journalism as it should be,04/26/2016,Sir Ben Jammin,Kelly McEvers and her team at NPR have put together one of the best podcasts I've heard in a long time. Embedded adds context to the headlines we think we understand and does a fantastic job giving listeners both sides of the story.,5
"Very enjoyable, informative, easy to listen to.",04/26/2016,DanielleNO,Enjoy this podcast very much. Highly recommend if you like NPR,5
Riveting,04/26/2016,kat_era,"I am so glad I started listening to this podcast. I'm not the type to write reviews, but I absolutely had to for Embedded. The journalism is honest and enthralling, the only criticism I have is that I wish the episodes are longer.",5

Like it - Wish episodes were longer,04/27/2016,jrsanchez716,Now I know that producing a good podcast takes a lot of effort. I really enjoyed the first several episodes. But I do wish that they went at least 45 minutes to an hour especially the one regarding Skid Row. It seems like that episode just dropped off - somewhat disappointing. Overall I like the concept and appreciate the long uninterrupted format. Keep them coming!,5
This is the first podcast I'm hooked on.,04/27/2016,JesseInMA,Great podcast!,5

Love this,04/27/2016,TerriboBerri,I've always loved the idea of investigative journalism. I love the idea of sneaking a peek into these different worlds. Loved the Waco biker episode...so crazy how ordinary men can become so lost in group mentality.,5

"Provocative, first-person insight into the modern world",04/27/2016,Joshjmack,"A fantastic podcast that embraces the stylistic voice popularized by ""Serial""- raw, unfettered journalism

New favorite,04/27/2016,Joreyhurley,"Kelly McEvers is my new imaginary best friend! Seriously, though this podcast gives you the chance to go in deep on some really intense, fascinating, and extreme situations. And see how relatable and universal the thoughts and emotions of the participants are. Looking forward to more -- and hoping for her to embed at a big city ER, in a maquiladora or sweatshop, and with a coyote. Fun times.",5
Another winner for NPR!,04/24/2016,Pandora's Abyss,I heard about this podcast while listening to Serial. I have to agree that this podcast is very well done and keeps the listeners attention from beginning to end. Well done!,5
Good balance between shoot first and ask permission.,04/24/2016,"Cliff, Cliff‚Äôs Ocean",It‚Äôs nice to have first hand accounts of what‚Äôs happening from people in the situations. That‚Äôs crucial. The team also attempts to find a voice for different sides of an issue which is appreciated.,4
Journalistic Story- telling done right,04/24/2016,yecart81,"I have come to expect much from NPR podcasts. They are done so well. Embedded doesn't disappoint. I had been searching for a new entertaining and enlightening podcast when I checked the charts and found this one - that was 24 hours ago - and I have now listened to all 6 currently available. The storytelling is so important but even moreso the narrator must buy good. Have a certain umami that's almost indescribable and that element exists because of Kelly as she draws you in and makes you feel like you are right there with her. I am all caught up so for now, as with my other favs like this American life, Radiolab, and Reply All, I have to wait until the next episode. I don't know why more people do not listen to podcasts, but for now, their loss! Highly recommend",5
Great Reporting,04/24/2016,Dayton Dad,The first three episodes were very interesting and were over way too fast. Keep up the great work!!,5

It's like Serial,04/25/2016,GTangarang,"But a lot shorter. I mean that in both a good way and a bad way. I like that Embedded changes topics on a weekly basis, but I wish it was longer and looked at topics even more in depth.",5

Great show,04/26/2016,Cambalu,The first 3 episodes have been great. Interesting and thoughtful reporting,5
New fave!,04/22/2016,Music20Lover15,I love this concept. We all get the basics of a news story but this delves deep and gives us a closer look. It's always interesting learning about people who are different than you are or new to you.,5

Interesting & well done,04/23/2016,NotoriousNina,"This podcast was an instant favorite of mine! The stories grab my attention from beginning to end, and are an interesting and unique take on news stories we've all heard. Well done",5
Wish Kelly mcevers would leave her opinion out of it,04/23/2016,Factsnotopinions,"Enjoyed ep 1 and 2. But bothers me that Kelly always tries to be cool with her sources and acts like she's their friend, then later judges them during her closing monologue. It's always as if she befriends them to gain their trust, then backstabs them with a bad comment. She should just report the stories without including her opinion. I felt bad for her sources.",3
"Great podcast, I listen to every episode",04/23/2016,just-mccoy,"If you enjoy long-form reporting, this is an excellent podcast. Insightful, great reporting by the NPR team.",5
Excellent,04/23/2016,Murph011,"Excellent podcast. The embedded podcast makes the effort that most major media outlets no longer attempt. Because of that, the stories are rich with facts and perspectives you cannot find anywhere else.",5
Awesome,04/23/2016,Sombodysom1,I have to admit I think I like this more than serial every story so far has been awesome.,5
Got hooked from the get go!,04/23/2016,Sunarsor,"I can't get enough of the detailed, vivid stories told by the Embedded team. Kelly goes deep into the roots of each case. Top A+ investigation and reporting job by Kelly. Keep on telling great stories for general listeners.",5
Needs Improvement,04/24/2016,RP11374,"This show has a lot of potential. It tries and succeeds at emulating This American Life features. However, I find myself increasingly annoyed by Kelly's tone. It is often exasperated, judgmental, and exaggerated. I would like to hear some empathy, thoughtfulness, and astuteness that is poignant, not jestful. This small adjustment would make the show considerably better.",3
Good concept - Bad Narrator,04/24/2016,JimmyFBabbbbby,"Great NPR idea yet again - solid stories.

I wait for the next one to arrive,04/24/2016,VintageJourneys,"These In-depth journeys into the challenges of our time are enlightening and inspiring.

Phenomenal,04/21/2016,Florida recycler,"I've always enjoyed Kelly McEver's reporting and found her work to be fantastic. In Embedded, she takes it to a whole new level - and in the process she is performing a valuable service. So much of our news consumption is bite size. We see a headline and a brief summary, and then - nothing. Perhaps a follow-up that's relegated to the digital equivalent of the newspaper, page C27, buried out of sight. But Embedded digs in deep and asks questions that make you think, make you want to look into something further. It's some of the best storytelling/reporting in podcasting.",5

Episodes are too short,04/22/2016,amorrismich,"The audio quality is great (I love the use of ambient sound that NPR is known for). My biggest problem is that you can't really cover the problems in Waco, El Salvador, etc. in 30 minutes. The team behind Embedded should really try to have a 1 hour programming slot as time goes on.",4
NPR does it again,04/22/2016,Waterman45,"First serial and now this, my two favorite podcasts by a wide margin.",5
Expat review,04/22/2016,Olmue Ann,"Kelly and team, THANK YOU! I recently subscribed to NPR One, and found Embedded there. It keeps me informed and engaged, and very entertained. I don‚Äôt miss living in the USA, at all, but I do miss great investigative journalism with a very human angle. Thank you so much for this dedicated, sincere, and insightful reporting. Looking forward to more.",5

captivating & great production value,04/22/2016,crg_v,"The use of narrative, musical accompaniment, and audio recordings from each subject makes this similar to Serial or This American Life. The stories are captivating and really fascinating to listen to. Embedded shows, rather than tells.",5

Quickly becoming my favorite podcast,04/21/2016,Fhbjkjtffggjvvv,"I love the imagery this podcast gives. My favorite one so far was the El Salvador one, I could imagine the environment, walking around and feeling the tension the gang brought. I felt as if I was in the shoes of the homeless people on skid row. I love what this podcast shows and talks, please keep them coming.",5
Wonderful in-depth reporting,04/21/2016,Kickinthefunk,"I love this podcast, it is bound to deepen your understanding and empathy for different perspectives",5

New favorite podcast,04/21/2016,DBD625,Love it. My new favorite podcast,5
A Weekly Serial,04/21/2016,Ijusydontxare,"Yes, I'm aware Serial was weekly, but it on one subject. Embedded has the same focus of serial, but shortened to a quick thirty minutes. Highly engaging, interesting topics and that classic NPR style of reporting makes Embedded one of the better new podcasts around.",5
Wanted to like it but it is terrible,04/21/2016,Pseudobrainy,"For a show that is intended to go deep there is a decided lack of depth to the stories. There is merely exploitation of trite generalizations and sensationalism. Where‚Äôs the background? the research? the political and historical perspective? Just jump into a situation, spend three days, do a poor job of editing and stream it. I listened through to today and the skid road episode but won‚Äôt be listening anymore. The tone of this episode was truly awful, I did not find any content here that added any value to these tremendous problems in any meaningful way. Oh wait I see, I just went to the NPR website and see that this episode is a rework of content delivered on the radio a year ago. Well all the worse then. I am a serious podcast listener and am seeking thoughtful content developed for podcasts. This episode was a poorly cooked hash of leftovers.",1
Love it,04/21/2016,loloChrisine,"I enjoy listening each week . Well produced and I like how, it's based on real stories .",5
Awesome,04/21/2016,neuron1,Great podcast. Definitely check it out.,5
"Addicting, in-depth show",04/21/2016,"Dr. K, M.D.",Love this show. So often media tells the start of the story and doesn't stay with the story or go in depth but Embedded does,5
Great show!,04/21/2016,Uuduviboh,I want more! Kelly tells a great story!,5
Terrific!,04/21/2016,ErikB008,"Terrific stories, like mini versions of the Serial podcast",5
Human stories behind the headlines,04/21/2016,Jesse Gi,"Kelly McEvers works hard to get the human stories behind the headlines. We need more of this investigative, old fashioned reporting in the media to tell the whole story and put things in context. Thank you Embedded!",5
Stellar work!,04/21/2016,paramedic192,"Kelly McEvers does some stellar work here! From someone who regularly commutes 2 hours to and from work, I would love longer podcasts. 35 minutes a week just isn‚Äôt enough.",5
Embd is Engrossing,04/21/2016,Lizardink,"I'm a picky podcast listener. Serial got me hooked on this media, and I love that I can come here to listen to smart people talk about smart ideas. Embedded is my new favorite. I love Kelly's style and will be back every Thursday to download for my evening commute. More please.",5
Fascinating,04/20/2016,Kellyannecakes88,"Kelly McEvers does a superbly amazing job describing each situation. You really feel like you are right there with her. And these are stories that you probably would not hear about unless you were a local to the situation. They are the perfect length, right around 30 minutes. Sometimes I sit in my car after I get to my destination to listen to the rest of the podcast. I would rather be late for where I'm going than wait until later to finish the podcast! Kelly should really receive an award for this work. I am so interested to hear this news, it gives me a new perspective.",5
Please Don‚Äôt Get Killed,04/20/2016,JS Caughlin,Just listened to the PodCast about El Salvador‚Äôs gangs. It is sobering what other people have to endure simply to live. I hope anyone with an opinion about immigration ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù would listen to this. Build a wall? How about build a bridge and help build stability? The U.S. had no problem dumping money back in the 80‚Äôs.,5
Engaging and informative.,04/20/2016,Llynnmcd,I heard about this from On Point. Excellent reporting in a very approachable format. Love it!,5

Fantastic,04/20/2016,Stupid girl,"Great stories! I'm half Salvadorian and hearing The Capital made me almost cry. To hear the sad truth that is going on in the world and how mishandled this (MY) country is, is very disheartening. Thank you for bringing this matter to people's attention. I hope you continue to bring real news to the world.",5

Hope it gets better,04/19/2016,ToooCute!!,The show was interesting but was ultimately anti climactic for me. The Waco one ended abruptly and seemed half hearted to me. I'm surprised it's rated so high!!,2
Great new podcast!!!!,04/19/2016,Nickname-H8R,In-depth look at issues at home and around the world. Great addition to my podcast collection.,5
Gritty and informative,04/19/2016,Hair2play,"I love this podcast. It is gritty, raw and has an immediacy that conventional news reporting no longer provides (they are too busy obsessing with Donald Trump for that). The pace is fast and furious and it's very clear that the creators are trying really hard to find the backstory that is more often than not, more interesting than the headline it authors. The episodes on San Salvador and the TX shootout just kept me riveted. Can't wait for more episodes.",5
Best since Serial 1,04/19/2016,Shannyskillz,"Love this, wish it was every day!",5
Amazingly put together,04/19/2016,Tt149,"One of my favorite podcasts, amazingly out together and so informational. Always covering critical issues that I feel get put on the back burner by the media.",5
Breath of Life,04/19/2016,bilbomagens,Without stories such as these we become blind to the issues of our neighbors and our world. Inspiring journalism and heart wrenching first hand accounts of the issues that should be on everyone's radar in the international community we exist in today.,5
One of the best,04/19/2016,Rilotron,I only wish that Kelly could embed us further. Easily one of the best programs out there.,5

So far so good!,04/19/2016,Dalebert_R,Liking it so far.,5
Wonderful story telling,04/19/2016,Lib675,"This podcast is gripping and insightful. You really do feel like you are part of a biker group or at the mercy of a Central American gang listening to these incredible, moving stories. This is most certainly worth the listen.",5
Going beyond the story you read about,04/19/2016,Angla18,But it is a very thoughtful and insightful journalistic venture. I have learned so much from the journey of the reporters during their time investigating the story. This podcast truly brings the lives of those affected into perspective that we would not know had it not been for this in-depth reporting. Thank you so much for taking the risks and going the extra mile to bring the real story to life.,5
Insightful stories,04/19/2016,EmalMe,I like the approach to go deeper into a story to find out more behind names. The house was a great episode but sad,5
"Elite white woman talks about stuff she ""doesn't get""",04/20/2016,ezragoldman,Mainly shows how elite white people are so out of touch with the reality of the world.,1
Love it so far,04/20/2016,Lou McLou,"Based on the first 2 episodes, I'm hooked. Great reporting, great storytelling. The way they gained the trust of the bikers and the addicts was impressive and made for 2 awesome episodes. Keep up the good work.",5

Trying hard to sound like Serial,04/18/2016,Bzzzzzzz,"Very formulaic, narrator aping Sarah Koenig‚Äôs ‚Äústyle‚Äù - half-curious, half clueless. I guess this is supposed to sound more relatable? But it comes off as amateurish. The narrator needs to develop her own voice, this is just derivative.",1
Brilliant,04/18/2016,MrsKDeyeeyeA,"Every episode is engaging, like a great book that I never want to end!",5
Yes!,04/18/2016,RAYCEism,I am so grateful for the intermingling of news factuals and on the ground coverage! This style feels so natural yet still intellectually stimulating.

Story behind the fast headlines,04/19/2016,Sophgunnink,"Today news seems to be faster and faster with a story entering and leaving the cycle within a matter of days. Embedded did the exact opposite, they tell the story in a slow methodical way that allows me to understand things I had previously just read the headline about. Kelly is very personable. She asks the hard hitting questions but is understanding enough to get almost anyone to open up to her.",5

Exceptional story telling,04/17/2016,Forever from Massachusetts,This method of in depth reporting is extremely captivating and the creators are doing an exceptional job of focusing on current issues. Their determination and ability to access primary sources is what makes each episode riveting. NPR podcasts are like a rabbit hole of amazing podcasts. Each one I listen to plugs another one to try and I've enjoyed everyone of them. This is the most recent I have found in that rabbit hole of exceptional journalism. Thank you.,5

Disappointed --Definitely Not the Quality of Serial,04/15/2016,Birdgrrl,"I love in-depth reporting and was looking forward to this podcast. However, I find it voyeuristic and somewhat shallow. The reporter almost seems like a naive suburbanite who thrills at exposure to ""the dark side."" What I found missing is sensitivity to the interviewees and possibly a lack of enough life experience to thoughtfully mine sensitive subjects. The reporter's cheery style and awkward questions made for too many cringe-worthy moments. The podcast also fails to put stories into their larger context. There are a lot of political issues impacting the Indiana addicts story related to education, the governor that could have made it more interesting and help people understand the complexities of how this addiction/HIV crisis happened in bucolic Austin, Indiana. The next story on the biker fight in Texas struck me the same. ""Ohh--bikers are kinda cool and scary!! What's their story? Look at us, we get to talk to cool, scary bikers!"" --is the tone of the story without a whole lot of other less than obvious insights. Other podcasts do it much better, especially This American Life, Serial, Only Human. Skip this one unless they up their game soon.",2
Great Podcast,04/15/2016,SentientEgg,Well produced and compelling. Even the stories I don't think I'll have any interest in are riveting and intriguing due to the production values.,5
Lack of research and empathy,04/15/2016,raterkater,Kelly McEvers seems to do little research on the topics she is reporting. She also lacks empathy for people who are struggling. I downloaded three episodes at one time to take with me to work. I gave each one a fair shot before giving this review. I have deleted the three I downloaded and will not be downloading anymore. I was very dissapointed with NPR for allowing this garbage to be aired and to have their name attached to it.,1
Brilliant concept and successful execution,04/15/2016,93cs,I love this podcast. It takes on interesting topics in an investigative manner that connects listeners with the story. NPR never fails to impress me - They tell the news of the people.,5

Very Insightful,04/15/2016,KLJ25,"Let's you learn deeply about news stories in the USA that you may not have otherwise. My favorite so far was ""Bikers""",5
Another example of stellar journalism by NPR,04/15/2016,gjcope,"NPR continues its tradition of producing quality programming with its newest podcast, Embedded. In a day and age where the public's collective attention span is comparable to that of a gnat, Embedded returns us to the days of honest-to-goodness investigative journalism. Instead of a 2-minute story, we are taken deeper into the story. We feel the tension and even fear that the reporters feel. Much of that immersion is due to the outstanding sound and music editing. We, the listeners, become embedded.",5
Great new show!,04/15/2016,jgrannis,So far so good! Great new addition to my weekly podcast routine!,5
Great podcast!,04/15/2016,o1t1w9b4,I found this podcast when I was looking for something similar to Serial. It's awesome - though I wish the episodes were even longer. I really admire Kelly McEvers for her bravery in reporting. She does a great job.,5
Loving This New Show!,04/15/2016,Newer Listener,"Really great work here.

More please!,04/14/2016,BorrowingEarth,"Ack! I want more! I just devoured the first batch of episodes, and I can't wait for more to come! This podcast is second only to Serial, you know, because it's Serial. Bottom line, bring me more Embedded!",5

"Gripping, satisfyingly soul-crushing",04/14/2016,TwoEffs38,"Not everyone lives to feel a range of emotions throughout their day like I do, but this podcast is well worth your entire capacity empathy in a day. A fantastic appreciation for humanity in what would otherwise be a snippet in a local paper. The stories told have familiar themes yet they are fresh and raw. So far I've found myself tearing up at every episode. The only change I would make would be to soothe the listener's sense of guilt by sharing a way to take action.",5
Enlightening and disheartening,04/14/2016,hidgrub,Every episode thus far has had me transfixed and so aware of how unaware I was of some of the details- humanizing events that are tragic and profound.,5
1st review I've ever written,04/15/2016,ppllaaiidd,"Short and sweet, Kelly does a terrific job enlightening us as to the issues in the world that actually are newsworthy. I've been a fan of Kelly's for years and I'm glad she's expanding her reporting!",5

Enlightening and affecting,04/14/2016,Jess Cohen,Absolutely love this podcast. It's so engrossing. I hang on Kelly McEvers' every word; she does an excellent job of drawing you in and keeping you interested. Her reporting and background research are thoroughly done and the production team does an amazing job as well. I'd definitely recommend this podcast to anyone who loves a good story!,5
Bite Sized Serial,04/14/2016,xXMr.MentosXx,"Its like Serial, just bite sized with everything contained in a single episode. I love it.",5
Top notch journalism,04/14/2016,David StL,I come away from each episode feeling like I've lived the event at hand.,5
Think Outside of Your Box,04/14/2016,Matt Lafleur,This podcast is an uncomfortable shot of brutal empathy. And it hurts so good.,5
Every single episode rivets me to the podcast,04/14/2016,MaryInFennv,"Just finished The Capital about El Salvador, the gangs, the killings. Other podcasts I can dip in & out, listening with half an ear. Not this one. And every time, I end so much more informed and empathetic. Awesome.",5
Real Journalism,04/14/2016,Vconmrtnz,As a Salvadorian American the latest episode really broke my heart. Thank you for bringing light to what is actually going on and why. It is the poor that have and continue to suffer because of political greed.,5
Amazing,04/14/2016,spthomas10,Listening to this gives me an empathy for different people across the world who I have never met. I'm grateful for this learning and growing - it's something I haven't experienced with any other podcast I've subscribed to yet.,5
Brillant,04/14/2016,srs65,"Love the all the episodes, easily one of the best podcasts out there.",5

Much Love for Embedded,04/14/2016,Better than Serial,I love this podcast more than Serial! I didn't think that was possible. Such fabulous reporting from a great perpective about news stories that I may have heard of but didn't pay much attention to. I love that Kelly asks the tough questions we all want to know the anwer to. Looking forward to hearing many more!,5
"Kelly McEvers = fearless, peerless",04/14/2016,Ameese1,"When I heard Kelly McEvers was going to stop being a war correspondent, I breathed a sigh of relief on her behalf. Somehow, she managed clear, concise, intriguing reporting while showing very little regard for her own safety - at least as far as listeners could tell. Now, listening to Embedded, I'm back to holding my breath. Throughout each episode, I feel like I'm right there with her - her narrative creates such vivid imagery. And I come away with far more insight into the subject than I ever thought possible. I'm consistently amazed at her fearlessness AND talent. Much, much kudos to Kelly and her team for the incredible work they do.",5
What news should be,04/14/2016,jhouchin2,"This is the best reporting I have heard in a long time. In-depth and muddy, no easy answers just well informed grey areas of an issues. I have listened to the first three episodes, and actively listened each time, and can‚Äôt wait for more.",5

Excellent podcast!,04/14/2016,Arlynn15,"It delivers a great humanizing side to news stories that otherwise could just feel cold and factual. 'The Capital' really hit me hard, because I spent a large part of my childhood in El Salvador. I can both understand and visualize the language, the area, and the culture of the people involved. I still know missionaries and nationals that live there; it's pretty intense. I definitely recommend Embedded",5
Solid journalism,04/14/2016,Dffujnbkop,"Good long form reporting, and thankfully without the snarky over produced sound production that's been in fashion.",5

Fresh & Worthwhile,04/14/2016,glocalb1,"Best new podcast in the news story genre. Seriously thought-provoking. Interesting. And lives up to its title: ""Embedded"" draws you into the story, makes the listener feel they are there. Quite a feat for an audio only format (and indeed if it were done on video, they probably would not be able to get access to many of the interviewees that are crucial to the story). Be prepared to become riveted into the story yourself as you start listening. I hate reality TV, but love this journalistic format that covers serious stories in an in-depth way, going beyond where others have tried (ABC 24 Hours, CBS 60 Minutes, etc).",5

Kelly is down to earth and touching, she gives these stories the human element that similar podcasts could never quite grasp. This show is an inspiration to any aspiring journalist.",5

Engrossing and Fresh,04/11/2016,Katieniekamp,"Though a new series, this podcast immediately found its voice. The host manages to strike a personal connection with each interview while still giving an unbiased report on the situation.

Compulsory listening,04/09/2016,Anna Fifield,I loved listening to Kelly McEvers' reporting from the Middle East so I was thrilled to discover she's applying that same tenaciousness and intrepidness in the U.S. I love that she's returning to stories after they're no longer in the news to dig into the back story. Slices of American life that I don't hear anywhere else on radio. Bravo Kelly.,5
So far...,04/09/2016,WisdomSeed,"I didn‚Äôt really care about the plights of white drug addicts. I still don‚Äôt but it was good to know that they are what they are. The episode on the shooting at Waco was really good. Not that I care anymore about white dudes playing motorcycle games, but it was sad to hear how the dude lost his friends. I suppose it is adding the humanity to stories that fly through the news cycle, that makes the podcast really worth it. While not getting all Serial about it, it is nice to see a good amount of time devoted to telling stories that take a while to work on.",5

After the first episode of this one I was already looking forward to the next episode. Just checked randomly this evening and see that it's posted. At least this will be something to look forward to listening to on Monday. Keep up the great work!,5
Amazing,04/08/2016,Topps fan,Amazing podcast!!! I was sold right away both stories are very interesting I wish their was more episodes out already.,5
5 stars,04/09/2016,ShelbyECook,"Kelly is concise with her words. She does not drone on with long intros, and the stories are interesting.",5
Good Listen,04/09/2016,Sjdjdjsjsjeoekdj,Interesting stories thus far.,5
This is genuine journalism,04/09/2016,KBGunny,"As in life, in radio journalism (or any honest journalism) there are not always easy answers and happy endings. This podcast illustrates that in spades. I have enjoyed both episodes so far even though there are no clear conclusions to the stories. However, I find the output of the work of this team useful and enlightening.",4

Another podcast addiction!,04/07/2016,Mefromnc,Like I need another way to blow my time! Thanks though. It's too good to miss!,5
Really great,04/07/2016,MrsKDiddy,I am really excited about this new podcast! The first episode was compelling and heartbreaking. The host does a great job with deconstructing her emotions about what's happening and admits to judgment she has but does it in a way where she understands what's happening and guides the audience to come to the same conclusion. Well done. I am excited for what's to come!,5
Sounds like this will be my new favorite podcast!,04/07/2016,abe614,Upon listening to every episode of the Criminal podcast I found myself bored with all the other pods I've subscribed to. Now that I just finished listening to the first episode of Embedded I am very excited because it sounds like it is going to be great! Has a similar feel as far as reporting style that Criminal uses.,5
NPR's best stories explored deeper,04/08/2016,Jpatticake,"You know that gripping NPR news story that had you hooked that then somehow disappeared from existence? Well podcast host Kelly McEvers gets gritty and seeks out the real thing, even if it means driving to the boonies to chill at an opiate house in rural Indiana or talking her way into a party to interview members of the biker groups involved in the Waco shooting.",5
Riveting,04/08/2016,JenStar100,"Kudos to Kelly McEvers for her riveting new podcast ""Embedded"". McEvers takes listeners to places where stories are happening, giving them gut-level insight into the sights, sounds, and people behind the news. Her narrative style makes you feel you're right there with her in places you've heard about but probably would hesitate to venture on your own. Outstanding!",5
Compelling,04/08/2016,Sarah Podcast Addict,Really loving this one! I've been listening to a lot of NPR podcasts and this one definitely does not disappoint. Kelly takes difficult (and potentially dangerous) stories and goes deep - all while taking us along for the ride. Absolutely a new favorite!,5

Can‚Äôt believe this is NPR,04/08/2016,21507,"This is pretty much ‚Äúif it bleeds, it leads‚Äù cheap journalism. I love NPR and this is so far beneath them I can‚Äôt even imagine who gave this the go-ahead. There is a good way to do really thought provoking, introspective pieces that center around a reporter being part of the story. And there‚Äôs a cheap, desperate way to do it. Unfortunately this is the latter. The reporter sounded excited to be watching people shoot up drugs, she provided step by step how-to instructions on how to cook pain killers including ways to remove the outer pill covering and filter out the additives, and she was completely ham handed in all her interactions with the people she was interviewing (people who were generally impaired by drugs, which I guess makes it easy to get their consent and makes for better radio) and barely touched on any of the background of the epidemic, the fact that these people were the epicenter of the recent HIV epidemic or anything other than ‚Äúwhat does it feel like to be high?‚Äù and ‚Äúso I hear you lost your children, what‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù I was so repulsed by the reporter by the end. Completely the wrong person for the job and the podcast was just filled with so many cheap ‚Äòshock‚Äô set up shots. It was more like watching Geraldo Rivera trying to spark a fight on stage while sticking microphones in people‚Äôs faces. So outside NPR‚Äôs usual quality of design, writing, reporting or execution of ideas.",1

Embedded within,04/08/2016,Kim Hurtt,"Exceptionally conceptualized, embedded is exactly the kind of journalism I crave. I'll be telling all my pod cast peeps to subscribe and share. Can we just send you everywhere we want to peek into? Yes, please.",5
Love it,04/08/2016,covvez,Great idea - a podcast reporter embedded in sub-groups most everyday people don't know much about,5
"Amazing... Seriously, Amazing",04/08/2016,B-McM,"I listen to 6 different podcast. All of them are great! But I have to say that even though this one is new it is definitely my favorite. I save it for last like I would anything I enjoy (dessert, for instance).",5
Awful,04/08/2016,Emcat525,"When I first heard this show being promoted on the NPR Politics podcast, I thought it was an April Fools' Day joke. in the promotion, the reporter sounds like a parody of Sarah Koenig and the show like a parody of NPR's occasional smug self-righteousness. Once I realized it was real, I figured I'd give it a try since I enjoy most NPR shows. I could barely make it through the first episode. The podcast name makes it sound like the point of the show is for the reporter to get deep into a story, making meaningful connections with the subjects and gaining new insight. Instead the first episode sounded like every other superficial story I've read/hear on opiate addiction. I'm not surprised that interviewees gave ""one word responses""; they seemed like they just didn't want to answer the dumb questions of a reporter who seems to have zero experience with the realities of drug addiction and no real concern for the people in the story. I might try another episode later, but I'm not sure why, since NPR is pushing this show so hard, they decided to lead with such a bland, pointless first episode. Shallow reporting narrated by Captain Obvious.",1
A Good Extension,04/08/2016,Arabesques,"Nice extension to the shows and interviews already provided by NPR, nice to dive in to the lives of others and hear candid, uncut conversations!",5
TIME FOR CHANGE,04/04/2016,RxKittycatloverRx,"It's time to start changing public opinion in regards to addiction. The media does a great job of showing us the worst of my kind. They show the worst case senecio of what drug addiction looks like. %1 of the substance enthusiast population is portrayed as will lacking, poor and uneducated. with any group of people there will always be those that take it to the extreme. For example Isis. That is probably less than %1 of people of the Muslim faith. We must resist the temptation to apply what we see on the news and apply it to all Muslims. Public perception has little remorse for addicts. They are ostracized from society and viewed as people that just need to summon the will to stop, pick themselves up by there bootstraps and surrender to a higher power. This story helps change that perception by showing non-users the complexities of physical opioid dependence. This was written by somebody that has a job, a family, a dream, and a life threatening disease that isn't curable but is treatable. Lets start treating addiction by changing perception towards my kind. We can't eliminate all drugs just like we can't stop people from humping, but we can invest in publicly funded programs that make it safe to do either one of those things. I dose intravenously (slam, shot-up, IV, bang, ride the Crimson cruise) 5-10 times a day, everyday, for 4 years and counting. That's a lot of needles! let's make it easy to get clean ones and properly dispose of used ones so that I can continue to have proudly never shared a needle. If it gets any harder and republicans (not exclusively) fight needle exchange services the way they fight planed parenthood centers I will join the community of my peers that have crossed that threshold. knowing I had exhausted every possibly resource within my means before resorting to doing the unthinkable. Addicts are people too, some of the %99 that aren't newsworthy may even be good, honest, kind, educated, empathetic, decent hardworking Americans that are treating themselves the only way they know how. Addiction itself is like a prison, what's the point of actually putting us in prison? Why waste taxpayer dollars on that. Let us use that money to make it safe and less judgmental to treat our affliction. It's scary and nerve wracking and full of judgmental eyes going in and out of a needle exchange. You wonder why people in ep.1 share in the first place. Why do employers drug test? That's like cancer checking an employee. It's a disease, we can't help it, please don't discriminate. I bet people with cancer would be in the news all the time for theft if we didn't let them have jobs either......",5

Simply outstanding!,04/02/2016,Huntryx,This in-depth look at what has become a very dark plague is timely as well as Revealing and a potent reality check as many communities have been caught offguard by the terrible consequences of this addiction.

Harm reduction,04/04/2016,Jcat pdx 45,Daily IV user myself. crippling physical dependence. Thank god I live in Oregon. Needle exchange near me/ you can legally purchase sharps at any pharmacy without a prescription or even proof that you are 18/ They also hand out narcan (reverses overdoses) to anybody that asks the friendly folks at 'outside in' the NEP that is closest to me. Oregon has reversed 200 + in the one or two years legislation allowed narcan. Also I have never had to share a needle. Never had an abbess. Always recycle. I still have to purchase micron filters online. Micron filters are the safest way to IV pharmaceuticals. If I didn't live in Oregon and didn't have easy and free access to sharps I'm afraid that in my weakest moments of unbearable shaking and WDS that I could have found myself in a similar situation as these guys. Please consider finding out the policies in your states and help people like me that need harm reduction.,5

The truth of the matter is that addiction to pain killers (or addiction in general) is non-discriminatory and it affects people of all social classes and tears families apart.

I brought my sibling back to our home state , helped him get Medicaid and into rehab. He's clean and sober 1 1/2 years, works full time and is a contributing member of our society.

So sad,03/31/2016,Joe McDevitt,I just finished the first episode and I am crushed. Hearing the story of these poor folks that are plagued by addiction was hard. It helped to really see a problem that is so prominent in our country. Not to mention I have a new sympathy for people suffering from addiction. It's so terrible to know that this first story didn't have a happy ending. Things didn't get better for most of the people in this story and that is so sad. I really appreciate the deep dive into this story. It did a great job of putting a face to an issue. Personalizing and humanizing a problem can really emphasize it.,5
