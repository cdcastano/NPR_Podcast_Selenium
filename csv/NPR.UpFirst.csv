It‚Äôs all right, NPR, things happen and no one is perfect! Im just glad I‚Äôm not going crazy, or that the government did not decide to censor my favorite and the most true and honest form of news!

A Nice Complement To Morning Edition,04/27/2019,CharBirdRay,"I‚Äôve listened to Morning Edition and All Things Considered for as long as I can remember ‚Äì perhaps from the 70‚Äôs if these shows have been around that long. I recently heard about Up First and I‚Äôve been listening now for about 3 weeks. I like it! It‚Äôs short and to the point, and for the most point very objective, like most NPR programs. I listen to Up First while I‚Äôm making coffee and organizing things in the kitchen before I settle down to read the paper and listen to the full Morning Edition show.",5
Essential,04/30/2019,DLeigh03,Up First has become an essential part of my morning routine. The podcast provides a concise and fair summary of the most important national and world news.,5

Planet money?,04/30/2019,emma_h11,"Anyone else have their Up First podcast switch to Planet Money all of a sudden? I can't find Up First anywhere on Apple podcasts now when I search... It also replaced my Wait Wait Don't Tell Me podcast with How I Built This. What's going on, NPR?",5

Bait and Switch,05/01/2019,DarKnyht,I have been an Up First listener for almost as long as available. Was disappointed today when I started it up to hear the news only to find that it was no Planet Money. Up first now no longer exists apparently.,1

What happened to Up First?,05/01/2019,aesshsliegy,"I rely on Up First for my news everyday. I‚Äôve loved it! But this morning it was replaced with Planet Money. I listened to a couple episodes and like it, but I need my news too! Please fix this and bring Up First back.",5

Love the show ... but..,05/01/2019,Skippy8984,Why was Up First removed from my podcast list and replaced with Planet Money... which I already subscribe too so I have 2 of those and no Up First üò≠,3
Up First is ruining feeds,05/01/2019,50FT woman,"Please stop loading Up First into other NPR podcast feeds!!! I unsubscribed from Up First because I don‚Äôt like it, and I will unsubscribe from Planet Money and NPR Politics if you keep using my subscription to these podcasts to push me to Up First.",1
Best way to stay informed! I don‚Äôt watch tv I listen to NPR,04/22/2019,Gouge71,The 12 minutes of concise reporting keeps me up to date on national and world events. I listen first thing as I make breakfast. The download happens seamlessly.,4
No longer works,04/22/2019,SDC law,"I listened faithfully for a quick hit of the news. Starting a couple of weeks ago, none of the episodes download. I tried using a different pod app with no access.",1
Too many personal opinions,04/22/2019,ashleighlyn,"I used to listen to this podcast every morning while I got ready for work. I chose this podcast because NPR has traditionally been unbiased in their reporting; they would give readers or listeners the facts and details and allow them to come to their own conclusion. Over the past year I have noticed more and more opinions within reported domestic political stories than should be incorporated. For this reason, I will no longer listen to Up First in the morning and will look for another, less biased news podcast.",1
Just the right amount of news I need..,04/22/2019,jakes_girl,"This is just the right amount of news for the day I need to be aware of what‚Äôs going on around me daily. If it was longer, I‚Äôd tune out but it‚Äôs just right - quick and to the point. I like the on the spot reporting and extra podcasts they release for special events to hear more. Keep up the good work! Love it!!",5
Rachel Martin needs to go,04/23/2019,anonfromatl,I like the podcast. It‚Äôs a good summary of news without the overload. Only complaint I have is about the host Rachel Martin. Her manner of speaking is irritating and she hardly ever asks any good questions. Seems not very knowledgeable. Her ‚Äúvoice language‚Äù has too much personal opinion she is suppose to be a news reporter not a commentator.,4
Best way to start your day!,04/23/2019,Horsey dog,I love this podcast. It‚Äôs only 15m and covers all the important stories for the morning. I can‚Äôt imagine having my morning commute without Up First! Please DO NOT cancel this podcast!,5
Great news recap,04/23/2019,M.Carrollton.TX,"If you‚Äôre like me and tired of the nonstop, wall to wall TV coverage that covers the hyped up opinions more than the facts, Up First is a treasure! A concise yet thorough recap of the days national and international news.",5
Great factual reporting,04/23/2019,DJüî•üíñ,So very professional and factually loaded. I thank you for your reporting. I listen every workday morning.,5
Daily News at its Best,04/24/2019,brian.payne2,"There's no better way to start your morning than this podcast. It's the perfect length for my morning walk with my dog, and I get a quick update on all the major happenings around the US and world. NPR reporting at its finest!",5
Excellent and quick news,04/24/2019,adk2011,Most of the important news of the day in a very easy-to-digest (12ish minute) format.,5
Great start to my day,04/24/2019,Meeples Schmeeples,Live up first! I listen to it while walking my dog in the morning. Just enough info from my favorite hosts to keep me informed. Keep up the good work!,5

Concise and accurate,04/24/2019,eurekajoe,"I find Up First to be a great way to start the ‚Äúnews day‚Äù. To the point, objective and sometimes even quite funny!",5
Important news in 15minutes,04/24/2019,Tony leshel,Great way to start the day by getting everything you need to stay ‚Äúin the know‚Äù. The only suggestion I have is maybe incorporate a little music to keep things interesting. Like the daily. Great job keep up the good work.,5
Good quick news review but with serious leftist bias,04/25/2019,independent from nj,"I‚Äôve listened to Up First for more than 2 years now. I‚Äôm a libertarian, and clearly this podcast has a left-leaning anti-Trump bias. Not a Trump fan, but personally, I‚Äôd rather hear the news and make up my own mind. Rachel Martin has a great voice but inexplicably delivers her lines in a sing-song voice, as if the message itself was not entertaining enough. Turns the serious news of the day into a morning zoo news. Then, in a bizarre contrast, when delivering sad news, she turns into a 1960‚Äôs golf announcer from the putting green. David Greene also has a great deep voice but the ‚Äútell‚Äù is that he squeaks when describing something he finds incredulous. When interviewing other people, they all transition questions with a sentence or two summary which is oversimplified and clearly biased. They all do this, But Inskeep is the worst offender. Noel King is the most professional. Wish there was a generic non-biased alternative. Listen at your own risk",3
Close to what should be up first,04/26/2019,GESB,"I listen to this most mornings. I don‚Äôt know why we can‚Äôt have it on weekends. Things happen on weekends, it‚Äôs not even the weekend worldwide.",3
Red,04/26/2019,Stan from Van,Gives you the news in the morning.,5
Room for Imorovement,04/26/2019,"Napa, California listener","I love NPR and have been a subscriber and avid listener for many years. I listen to Up First on about a daily basis. I feel it is inferior to The Daily and Post Reports which I also listen to about daily. I appreciate that this podcast is a more comprehensive survey of daily news than my other two ‚Äúregulars‚Äù, but feel it could be improved with less of the hosts, particularly Rachel Martin, inserting their personalities, emotions and attempts to be funny and entertaining into the production.",4
Helpful!,04/26/2019,Katie Dgren,"I love getting a quick synopsis of the top news stories of the day to keep me up to date with current events. They include the perfect amount of relevant details in each story to give you more than just the headline, but not so many details that the podcasts lasts longer than necessary. I give it 4 out of 5 stars, because - like most news publications in 2019 - they often can‚Äôt help but reveal their left leanings in their (sometimes subtle) undertones.",4
"Stop with the ‚Äúcute‚Äù, ad lib intro riffing!",04/12/2019,StormOneThree,"Greatly appreciate this podcast (five stars). That said this new practice of disingenuous, impromptu, non-news related intros between the hosts needs to stop. This podcast is about getting important daily news and information quickly and today I treated to these clowns poorly singing ‚Äúso call me maybe‚Äù?!? If this was a one off I wouldn‚Äôt be wasting time leaving a review but this BS seems to be occurring more and more often. It‚Äôs not appreciated. How about sticking with professionalism I‚Äôve come to expect from NPR?",1
Morning routine,04/12/2019,Lilly Q.,I love waking up and listening to ‚ÄúUp First‚Äù when I get ready for the day. They‚Äôre engaging and succinctly highlight keep news topics. This podcast is a great way to stay updated on what‚Äôs going on in the country / world and allows me to do further research on issues I‚Äôm passionate about or just want to know more.,5
GOT Spoilers,04/15/2019,Carleeey,I listen to Up First while driving to work and was scrambling this morning to quickly turn it off when they said they would be giving Game of Thrones spoilers. In the age of DVRs and streaming you would think they would be smarter than to give spoilers less than 12 hours after such a big premiere. Glad I was able to turn it off before they ruined it for me.,1
My morning must-listen,04/15/2019,CarolTandava,A great podcast to get you up to speed in the morning.,5
Awesome,04/16/2019,JournalismStudent_,"I listen to ‚ÄúUp First‚Äù every morning. It is usually one of- if not- the first thing I do in the morning. I love the method they use to tell the stories; they find a way to tell every story in an engaging, interesting, and informative manner. I always find that the news they provide becomes relevant in my daily life too. It‚Äôs my easy and pleasurable way to be informed on what‚Äôs ahead for the day. I always recommend it to anyone who wants to have an easy way to keep up with the news of the day.",5
We enjoy the fresh open and factual news every morning a dawn.,04/16/2019,louhasaboat,We wake up every morning to Up First. We love the concise narrative of the events that effect the world around us in this focused 15 minutes. So fresh and open reporting.,5
Just enough.,04/16/2019,President Henderson,Every morning I listen to up first to just get what I need to know about the world. I really enjoy that the show takes a look at the headlines gripping the world not just one area.,5
Up First,04/16/2019,Stan P Rabe,"Up First is an outstanding review of the top news stories of the day. Even when I get behind on listening, it is a good reminder of how events develop.",5
Morning routine,04/16/2019,ahmed22d,Quick listen in the morning to get me going and up to date with the news of the day.,4
Disappointing,04/16/2019,jldela85,"Continual reductionist coverage of Bernie Sanders. Please, for the good of our county, try to be more fair in your rhetorical framing of such things. I don‚Äôt care if Bernie wins or loses but every time you warp the conversation you do a disservice to democracy.",1
Wonderful podcast,04/18/2019,chuckstrong,This podcast is great! I was skeptical at first but it is a great addition to my morning news.,5
Simple Round-Up of ‚ÄúImportant‚Äù Stories.,04/18/2019,baililou,"I love listening to Up First as it gives me a pretty good overview of what‚Äôs going on in the world..... sort of.
I do wish they put their political, anti-Trump-focused ‚Äúnews‚Äù stories on their special reports instead. I just spent 15 minutes listening to their Monday morning podcast, which was nothing but the Mueller report. Yeah, that stuff is neat and all..... but I highly doubt that is the ONLY thing that happened over the weekend, guys. Now I‚Äôm going to have to go listen to other podcasts to tell me some real news. BOO!",1
Aliquot of morning news,04/18/2019,margot13,"This has been perfect for my mornings, highly recommend.",5
Critical for understanding the day‚Äôs key news stories,04/19/2019,bvfevuwieiu g rf,"This is what gets me on track with what‚Äôs going on in the world every day. it‚Äôs a great short summary of all of the news to help to decide what to Pay attention to the rest of the day. Not too formal; sometimes funny, anchors do a great job at 5 am when they do this... 2 am for David Greene",5
Best News For Today,04/19/2019,Distono,"Love that I can listen to this podcast and mostly skip all the other longer form stuff, while still feeling informed. ‚úÖ",5
Good selection of news stories; poor hosts,04/20/2019,thebirdieking,"Up First selects 2-4 key stories to help start your day. Reporting is solid. Would be better if hosts would tone down their histrionics and hype, especially Inskeep and Rachel Martin. Both repeat the obvious and consistently try to put words in the reporters mouth. Finally gave up and now listen to NYT ‚ÄúThe Daily‚Äù. So much better reporting and host",2
Great informative podcast,04/20/2019,Jsoc211,Major news headlines,5
great start to the day,04/21/2019,banzai comma buckaroo,I listen to this first thing every morning.,5
DIY Mosul piece was great!,04/21/2019,a_little_pixelated,I love NPR Up First - the world is a complex and rocky place. Thank you for this little gem of hope - so welcome in a news atmosphere that seems to only follow stories full of discord and strife.,5
Great reporting,04/22/2019,HermJr,"I listen to this and another big morning news poscast, and I love how Up First covers slightly different topics, or has different angles and information than the other podcast. I get a great mix of news that keeps me informed without bumming me out.",5
Loss of neutrality,04/08/2019,LastSonofB,"This podcast was a great way to get a briefing of the top stories. I liked it for the neutrality of telling the news that I know NPR for. In the last half year it‚Äôs become like every other news source with biased host opinions. Going to look for a new source if the hosts don‚Äôt stop putting in their opinions. I want news, not an opinion piece.",3

Excellent news summary; presented in transparent tones,04/09/2019,eeliza,"Just the right amount of daily news for me. High quality content. I agree with other reviewers that the hosts‚Äô political leanings are often audible in their tones of voice and wry humor, especially about the US president. I am a listener who tends to share the hosts‚Äô perspectives. I don‚Äôt think that their preferences reduce the quality of content; it‚Äôs not an analysis program. However, I do think that expressing their preferences reduces quality of delivery. The show would serve all of us better if the hosts expressed less in response to the news they present.",5
Great podcast,04/09/2019,Ferlene,I appreciate the short format and absolutely love their Alexa version.,5
Great Show,04/09/2019,Keith Waddell,This is great show. It gets me up to date on news and that‚Äôs it. No bias. Just news. Love it!,5
Like regular Morning Edition but biased,04/10/2019,elegantplatypus,"I love NPR and particularly like the NPR One app. Despite what many people say I don‚Äôt find NPR‚Äôs normal programming very biased, but in this podcast the commentators, particularly Steve Inskeep, really let their personal (and universally left-leaning) opinions mix with the reporting. It must be intentional, because sometimes I‚Äôll listen to this podcast early in the morning and hear the same story later on Morning Edition and the reporting will be totally different. Really wish the professionalism was present in Up First.",3

Mostly Great,04/11/2019,qwerty7575,"This is a mostly great podcast, and probably one of the least biased that I‚Äôve heard. However, Rachel Martin is a BIG exception.

Pretty good,04/11/2019,Ben47031,"Pretty good news roundup.

A bit too much focus on American politics, given how brief the pod is.",4
Great for news,04/11/2019,LoracEvol,Up First condenses the top stories of the day into 10 minutes or so. It is how I keep up daily on current events.,5
Great until Exxon Mobil started advertising,04/11/2019,Emily Unhappy,"I‚Äôve been tuning into Up First regularly over the past few months and have really valued it for its upbeat, fast-paced, and wide-ranging coverage of the daily news. I have, however, finally decided to unsubscribe due to the now regular advertisements of Exxon Mobil‚Äôs carbon capturing technology. I find this quite distasteful. Exxon Mobil has a history of anti-climate change propaganda, and I think this advertisement plays right into their decades-long narrative of climate change denial and misinformation. I am disappointed in NPR for being complicit in the spread of this message and hope that you all will be more considerate in the future when vetting advertisers.",2
Up First,04/11/2019,MHWBF,I listen to this daily. My only problem is that Rachel weighs in too much with what is clearly her opinion. Sometimes it is just a long ‚Äúhmmmm.‚Äù Podcast has great content but Rachel needs to limit her extra sentence here and there.,3
Dependable News,04/11/2019,L. A. Williams,"I depend on Up First for reliable, impartial news to get my day started.

Rachel Martin, David Greene, and Steve Inskeep are brilliant reporters and they cover a variety of stories beyond our current president which seems to dominate the news outlets.",5
Disappointed lately,04/01/2019,gabspod,"I love NPR. And I‚Äôve listened to up first each morning for years. Lately I‚Äôve been disappointed and I think I‚Äôve finally figured out why. Up First is presenting the top 3 reporting stories of the day. What I want from Up First are the top 3 substance based stories I need to know, not what the news world seems sensational that day.",3
Ignore the Trolls,04/02/2019,Lukejdoyle,"This morning report is unbiased, thought-through and then analyzed. Will some people think of analysis as biased reporting? Yes ‚Äî but they are incorrect. If you disagree with the analysis, then you need to consider where else you are receiving your news or maybe checking your inherit biases yourself. Listen to a whole week of news here: you‚Äôll discover they are independent.",5

Great summary of things I want to hear about,04/03/2019,reginamrm,This podcast rarely includes a topic I‚Äôm not interested in. I like it a lot and want it to be one of the first things I hear when I turn on my NPR One.,5
A Morning Must,04/03/2019,KaySherman,"I listen to Up First every morning. The information shared is concise, applicable, and consumable.

Quick Summary of National Headlines,04/06/2019,Djuknow,"Great for getting a download on major nation headlines first thing in the morning on the way to work. I find it irritating the clear bias some of the commentators have while reporting. Specifically about the President. Give the facts, the good and the bad, instead of phrasing things in such a way of ""what could he possibly be thinking?"" Or a ""here he goes again"".. sort of reporting. I'm not pro or against, I want to know what is working, what is not, and why.",4
Fantastic!,04/07/2019,pppotter,"NPR‚Äôs Up first is fantastic. I no longer live in the US, so it‚Äôs great to catch up on some important news to keep a hang on things going in the states and around the world. The content is well edited and engaging.",5

No better way to start the day,03/27/2019,isa.kah,"I‚Äôve been truly obsessed with up first since a friend suggested the NPR One app several months ago.

Mara Liasson has no place on NPR,03/15/2019,tr..........,Mara Liasson consistently interjects her personal interpretations and biases into her reporting which is utterly inappropriate but also inconsistent with the fact based impartial reporting I expect from NPR.

Normally a decent source of truth,02/11/2019,squints222,I used to know NPR as a news source without political lean. I‚Äôm increasingly disappointed with the Trump-bashing on this program.,3
Not especially balanced.,02/12/2019,Greythorth,"12 February 2019 update. New low in bias. Come on guys. Report the news.

Update: I just wanted to thank NPR for reminding me how incredibly biased they are. Normally I try to remember that I need to take everything they say with a grain of salt, but I also expect some journalistic honesty from them. Well, coverage of the Covington High School Debacle, which I happened to have followed more closely than most news stories, reminded me of how aggressively all reporting here is filtered though a specific narrative. That‚Äôs fine, as long as I remember that anything they say is going to be skewed badly. I just hope that other listeners don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre getting objective news because if you do, this podcast will create a false picture of the world around you.",3
More biased opinions,02/12/2019,dbm80401,After listening to today‚Äôs podcast (2/12/19) there was too much Trump bashing that it‚Äôs clear this is propaganda rather than journalism. I‚Äôm no Trump supporter but I‚Äôm tired of bias vs ‚Äújust the facts‚Äù reporting. Goodby NPR!,1

Warm up,02/16/2019,micahgaleg,Literally my warm up podcast everyday. Just in case I don‚Äôt get to listen to news and lets me also know what to listen for during the day with so much Information coming at me.,5
Trump mouthpiece,02/17/2019,The Real Zen Boy,"The political coverage is extremely unprofessional. After every other news agency realized the mistake they made by being Trump‚Äôs publicists, NPR has decided to double down. There was one episode where the Trump Administration did something completely incomprehensible and offered no reason, the host asks the reporter what explanation/reasoning was being offered, and after saying they offered nothing proceeded to offer her own explanation of what she thought they might say. It was the absolute low point in NPR news coverage. Every single episode starts off with whatever inconsequential thing Trump is doing. It‚Äôs absolutely childish and pathetic. Meanwhile there are major news events going on that they completely ignore. Hurricane destroying your state? Too bad, we are going to lead with Trump goes to a campaign rally, and might mention you at the end. This podcast couldn‚Äôt be worse even if it was written by Trump‚Äôs press office, which considering the laziness of the reporters to actually go out and report the news, most likely is the case. Additionally, they go to great lengths to defend the indefensible, while ignoring the litany of felonies being committed by politicians. Instead of feeling more informed and educated, all you do is shake your head at lack of any journalistic standards whatsoever and feel like you completely wasted your time. There are much better news sources out there. This one is worse than Fox. After giving this one over a month of daily listens, I watched this podcast actively get worse with every episode.",1
I listen every weekday,02/18/2019,ann chick,I enjoy n appreciate Up First but I esp like that new top of show improv moment y‚Äôall! Much thx for all your fine work!,5
Mostly good,02/18/2019,Rrrobbbbb24,"I listen to Up First everyday and it‚Äôs good enough for me during a busy morning ‚ÄîI‚Äôm just not a fan of the brief banter at the start of some episodes. Maybe it works for other people, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that funny. It makes me cringe a little. Otherwise, I‚Äôll keep listening to it.",4
News in small doses,02/18/2019,cmdlvd,I enjoy listening to this podcast every morning and the variety of topics they discuss.,5
Less bias than NYT The Daily,02/19/2019,Lanzzzy,I prefer NPR Up First over NYT The Daily because there is less bias present in my opinion. The hosts of Up First complement each other well and don‚Äôt seem to be pushing any personal agendas (like Michael Barbaro seems to be doing...),5
Daily listener,02/19/2019,lakegirl78,Thanks for this brief and important bit of news to start my day.,5
Better for listening,01/25/2019,MrStoller,"Not a regular NPR listener, but always tried to be. This is a good 13 minute dive into the lead news story of the day (gov shut down, Russia election scandal) and then a global piece of interest. Third segment can wander into something softer for the sake of entertainment on slow news days. But for the quick hit, I trust I get the big update here in a style targeting the layman and not the Beltway zealot.",3
T,01/26/2019,ahhrudgeiy,Hey,3
GIve you a quick review of the day‚Äôs news,01/27/2019,Lvreader,"This is part of my morning routine everyday. It is a quick, down dirty review of the daily news. Do not expect in-depth coverage in a 14 minute podcast. As I read the other reviews I find it amusing that there is comparison with the Daily, I listen to both each morning. Upfirst gives me a quick review of what is happening, then I listen to the Daily for more in-depth analysis. Both are needed. Thanks you are appreciated.",4
The Best BEST BEST!,01/27/2019,phillaly,"I cannot believe a major complaint left about this show was that they may cover Beyonc√©, the queen herself. If you want your morning need to know news in a rapid fire, quick review, with occasional lighthearted report this is for you!!! I appreciate the occasional joke as the news cycle is entirely abysmal these days. Great work.",5
Perfect way to start the day,01/28/2019,cam328,I appreciate the mix of political and cultural news. The hosts do a great job of making the news relatable and accessible to a wide variety of people. Keep up the good work!,5

Nice quick news bites,01/31/2019,Mposter,Yes there is a bit of a left slant; you‚Äôre listening to NPR. I enjoy listening to this on my way to work as I don‚Äôt get up early enough for the Up First hosts‚Äô morning show.,5
Don‚Äôt waste your time.,02/01/2019,Lexcrui,This is a terrible example of a morning ‚Äúnews‚Äù podcast. It has been three days since the state of Virginia tried to pass a bill to allow abortion UP TO TIME OF BIRTH and this ‚Äúnews‚Äù podcast hasn‚Äôt said one word about it. This is sick. Give people the actual news rather than worrying about dissing the president or giving out crap that doesn‚Äôt matter.,1
"Up First, Always",02/01/2019,Shelbyloudelong,I love this podcast. It‚Äôs the first thing I listen to every weekday morning while walking my dog. The two hosts are upbeat and tell a good joke every now and then. It‚Äôs a great way to receive all the facts and not feel too overwhelmed. Love it!,5

It's up first for me,02/02/2019,Cary A G,This is the first thing I listen to in the morning. It plays while I walk the dog and gives me a clue what things happened overnight. Thanks!,5
Biased,02/04/2019,Parellistudent,Steve Inskeep is EXTREMELY biased and incredibly challenging to listen to. I find him obnoxious and too opinionated. The other hosts are more manageable. I'd give the podcast a four star review if they had another host. I want the news not their take on it.,2
Literally the First Thing I Do When I Wake Up,02/05/2019,Alicia Magee,"A perfect summary of the previous day's (and sometimes night's) news.

Great for NPR listeners,02/05/2019,jpgillam,"If you like National Public Radio, ""Up First"" is a good news roundup while making your morning beverage. It provides the headlines heard on the NPR One app, but with more context. If you hate NPR, this podcast keeps it to a small dose.",5
"It‚Äôs not up first, I am",02/06/2019,magikmofo,"I am a sustaining member of NPR and the content of the podcast is great the problem is the time that it‚Äôs released every day. It‚Äôs usually available between 6:15ish-7:00am. I‚Äôm already at work by that time. Also, I hear all the news in the podcast on the regular station in my morning commute. If your commute or daily schedule is around this time then I think it‚Äôd be great for you. I‚Äôm an early riser (up first) and the content is released to late.",3

It‚Äôs get you caught up,01/21/2019,Genny K,"I listen to this to get the most important news I need before heading to work. It is great because it‚Äôs very quick and hits 2-4 high points. Reading all the negative reviews, I just don‚Äôt see it, but I‚Äôve only been listening for 2 months. I never heard a Beyonc√© newscast but I imagine it would frustrate me as well.",4
NPR‚Äôs UP FIRST offer good daily recap,01/21/2019,NPR for me,"If I miss the morning news on the radio or my phone or the daily paper, Up First offers a fine recap of the headlines I need to know. Then I read further about the key news later that day.",5

Great but just needs one small change.,01/21/2019,daultoninw,"I love the podcast and listen to it almost every morning on my smart speakers (amazon Echo) in my apartment. My one tiny change is that they should say the date at the beginning of the podcast. Since I‚Äôm just saying, ‚ÄúAlexa, play the Up First podcast,‚Äù I have to assume that it is playing the latest episode.",4
A nice concise look at today‚Äôs news,01/21/2019,Silvrfox24,"This podcast is the way I start my day. I appreciate the concise approach the team uses, and yet they give me enough depth in each story to make it very interesting.",5

‚ÄúBoth sides‚Äù reporting now available on digital,01/21/2019,Gryffon505,Today‚Äôs revisionist report on the Covington Catholic students‚Äô racially motivated harassment of Nathan Phillips is the last straw.

Impartial news?,01/24/2019,555Juan,"A bit more left-leaning than I‚Äôd prefer for my go-to news source. NPR does so less than others, but I still wish the broadcasters of this show kept to strict impartiality.",4
Used to be good,01/25/2019,Codeman81,"I would love this podcast if it wasn‚Äôt so bias. It‚Äôs obvious you guys all lean very far left, which is fine, but it would be nice if you reported both sides of each story. Every episode lately is focused on Trump and how bad you all hate him, not what‚Äôs happening in the world..there has to be more news than this.",1
A fabulous morning summary of the past day's events. Pairs nicely with a cup of coffee or tea.,01/25/2019,player66,"I've subscribed to Up First since the earliest daily episodes. Sinnce then this has been my podcast ""alarm clock"" for the morning and frequently paired with my first cup of joe.

Wednesday Jan 9th,01/09/2019,pauljquilter,"I listen every day. I want to pull you up on the Trump wall report this morning. About the policeman that got killed and was used by Trump last night to spread fear. The policeman was also an immigrant right. So am I. I went through the legal process in order to be here. Presumably so did the policeman. You kind of skipped over whether his killer had done. I think if one accuses Trump with being economical or loose with the truth, which he is, it is best not to employ the same tactics he uses. Of course at least Trump is blatant when he does it one might say ‚Äúhonest‚Äù. Hearing that part of this mornings report really aggravated me. Neither is NPR too high and mighty to stoop to hoodwinking the public.",4
"Great content, current software bug.",01/09/2019,Tsxtasy,"Content plays about 2x as fast as normal. Everything is sped up, and the commentators sound like chipmunks. Sounds like the guy at the end of a drug commercial telling you about the 1000 side effects in 3 seconds",1

The breakfast of news champions,01/15/2019,LaserJockey,"I listen to Up First every morning after NPR‚Äôs national and local newscasts. This show is the best way I‚Äôve found to dig into the four or five biggest stories in the country and world (US centric but important international news is covered) every day for 15 min before work. The show gives more in depth discussions than NPR‚Äôs national newscasts and feels more balanced, measured and serious than NYT‚Äôs The Daily.",5
As Advertised,01/15/2019,JWSkills,"I like it, so I came to leave a review. But after reading a few reviews left by others, many of whom seem to strongly favor NYT‚Äôs The Daily, I hesitated and decided to check out the competition. My conclusion: Daily is good, yes, but far too long and far too narrow. NPR‚Äôs Up First is, as advertised, a short, quick listen that hits the 2-3 big stories of the day, letting me know what to watch/listen for as I go through the upcoming day. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wanting, and that‚Äôs what NPR delivers. The NYT podcast will probably be added to my short list, but I don‚Äôt have time to hit them up on the daily (pun intended) and will still keep NPR up first (yes, I did it again).",5

"Noel out, Mary Louise in",01/03/2019,SeldomPoster,"Mary Louise Kelly has a speaking voice not particularly well-suited for radio. When I heard her for the first time on Up First about a year ago, she reminded me of David Brinkley, with her overly deliberate phrasing. She also seemed be trying to talk at a lower register than she is capable of. But a year later, having heard a little more of her on other programs, I can tell that she is pretty good as far as content. In the meantime, I feel that Noel King, for all her cheerfulness, lacks depth and substance. I criticized Mary Louise in this forum when she was on.

Inskeep- sooo biased,11/24/2018,jpierce1989,"I am tired of politician bashing in this country. When I listen to a ‚Äúnews‚Äù show that is supposed to be unconflicted, it frustrates me when one of the hosts can‚Äôt stay neutral. It is so clear the Steve Inskeep has a disdain for our President in how he rephrases answers given by the reporters and, in particular, how he ‚Äúreminds‚Äù us of prior POTUS missteps. This is not ‚Äúnews‚Äù but political bias at its worst! It‚Äôs really too bad as I believe Rachel, Noel, and David keep it real.",3
Worst Bias Reporting,11/24/2018,jjbarbie,Really hoping this would be a nice quick update for daily news. Consider myself neutral party on politics and issues. Yet they continue to ‚ÄúTrump Bash‚Äù to a point where it‚Äôs just ugly. Give up the bias point (we get you dislike Trump) but PLEASE just report the news.,1
Unprofessional Technique Used to Seem Relatable,11/25/2018,Listener1994,"NPR has always been the pinnacle of journalism in my mind.
But, very sadly, this series is a prime example of why NPR no longer deserves that acclaim. It breaks my heart to say that NPR is no longer even the leader in radio journalism and this series has cemented that reality for me.",1

"Good, but definite political slant",11/27/2018,Lhmhdyhi,This mostly does a good job of covering the big stuff. Rachel Martin really shows her bias whenever Trump‚Äôs name comes up. Lots of politics and less worldly stuff. But overall it‚Äôs my top choice for a quick news update in the morning.,4
My go to source for news,11/27/2018,krkumar11,"My life has gotten hectic, and I don‚Äôt have time to read through pages of in-depth articles or think pieces about daily events. Up First is a great way for me to get a snapshot view of major stories.",5

Lack of Professionalism,11/30/2018,tlp,If this was truly a respected news program then they would be reporting the news without all the sarcasm and snide remarks. Report the facts and respect people enough to form their own opinions and conclusions. THAT is good reporting.,1

"Keep your attitude out, Richael",11/03/2018,minghui420,"In the latest episode, Up First covered the case between AACE and Harvard. When the guest introduced the two sides, Richael just gave some obviously different response. When AACE, she emmmed, but for Harvard, she directly said Right. I do not like this sitting in one side for a news host, who‚Äôs work just introduced the questions. Yes, I am an Asian. And I felt being offended.",1

Great way to stay informed,11/06/2018,blegg30,"I‚Äôve avoided the news for so long. Politics cause great stress for me, the amount of hate in the world is sickening.

Thank you for a concise but thorough show.",5
Liberal and Global,11/06/2018,upn0rth,As a daily listener I find their view point very left of center. I don‚Äôt understand why they must have two stories. One US based and then something global. Today is Election Day and the global story was about Cameroon. Why?,3
Formulaic and Underwhelming,11/07/2018,Mjask206,"Like many other reviewers, I agree that a short-form, quick hit news podcast is the best way to start the day. I‚Äôve subscribed to Up First for around two or three months at this point, and, after giving it the opportunity to grown on me, I‚Äôve found that it is not hitting my expectations. The hosts undoubtedly let their various biases shine through, which is troubling no matter where you fall on political, social, and cultural spectra. Also, I feel as if the show could benefit from bringing new ideas to the reporting table like The Daily has. These points aside, it‚Äôs just also not very engaging and gripping. A 1-star rating would be unfair because their work to gather and report things by 6am ET should be appreciated, but I ultimately feel like more value can be found elsewhere in the podcasting world.",2

COFFEE. HOT SHOWER. UP FIRST.,11/09/2018,pesuj,I have my perfect routine to wake up in the morning and it HAS to include this podcast. I will go out of my way to recommend this podcast! The topics chosen range to light hearted pop culture news to breaking the news about a mass shooting that happened overnight while you were sleeping. They only have 15 minutes (or so) per episode to fill you in....so don‚Äôt expect them to hit every single tidbit of news that YOU personally would like to know about. They just choose the most important. Try this podcast out!!,5

Thank you for starting my day off right!,11/09/2018,Daawifey,"This is the first thing I listen as I make my morning coffee. I love your equal and balanced approach to global and national news. But mostly, I love the fact that with this latest incident of mass shooting, you did not so much is mention the shooter‚Äôs name. Thank you! We are a nation held hostage by a political structure that cannot figure out appropriate gun laws, but at least you have done what you can by removing the notoriety factor. I noticed, and I appreciate it more than I can say. Thank you!",5

Basically Clickbait in Audio,11/12/2018,Peter Hanging,"Two main lines that just slimed their way out of my phone speakers. ‚ÄúOur colleagues have pointed out, as you just did there, that there were a lot of young people there yesterday evening.

Short and to the point.,11/13/2018,Scottin3d,"I listen to this podcast every morning to get a balanced take on daily news. I try and get new from as many different sources as possible. Although it is NPR, there is an undeniable liberal bias to the reporting.",3

Increasingly One-Sided,11/23/2018,crlyn8,"I used to love this podcast as a way to get a quick scoop over breakfast before starting my day. It has become increasingly biased and overwhelmingly focused on DC politics over the past few months, ironically while criticizing others for making things political and divisive. I intentionally listen to NPR to try and get a somewhat objective view, but they‚Äôre losing me. I‚Äôve been meaning to try out a new morning show for a while, but have just been too lazy to take the time. Today‚Äôs was bad enough to finally give me the motivation.",3

My go-to.,10/30/2018,Awaulrus,"I have been tuning in to Up First for almost three years nonstop. This podcast is meant to give the most prominent political headlines each morning.

Good source for quick morning USA news digest,10/30/2018,a_clanc,"I‚Äôve found this podcast to be a good source of the major USA headlines in quick soundbites.

The focus is usually around the USA President, politics and other major stories that impact USA. The podcasters do try to touch upon global issues and news, but I will warn that almost anything related to the nation‚Äôs politics takes precedence.",4
Great stuff,10/30/2018,FynniganJ20,And just the right amount. Thanks guys!,5
Too Biased,10/30/2018,EmeraldEyes28,"Have been listening to this podcast for about a year. It is left leaning, as you would expect from an NPR show. However, there are just times when they cross the line from left-leaning to absolutely ridiculous biased opinions reported as news. This morning was one of those mornings and I finally gave up. As they are reporting that our president is headed to Pittsburgh to pay respect to the victims and their families, Steve states that the president is not a consoler that he‚Äôs only interested in conflict, and driving divisions that work for his policies. Really? Is this news a fact or your biased opinion? I finally gave up on the show and unsubscribed.",1
Good way to start the day,10/30/2018,Pmanzella,"I‚Äôve been listening to this on the NPR One app, but now that I realize it is available as a podcast, I‚Äôll probably start downloading it to give me more flexibility in when to listen to it. NPR doesn‚Äôt have the hype/phony excitement that a lot of other media outlets have. I feel like the listener gets a more in-depth and less politically-slanted view on the news. Give it a try.",5
President Trump,10/31/2018,0ctavia,I would like to not wake up to President Trump everyday. I like this podcast but I don‚Äôt care about Trump. He‚Äôs terrible I know but give me some thing more important than that fool. Thanks. Improve please.,3

Both,10/31/2018,bf podcast listener,I don't know why everyone is comparing this to the daily? I listen to both. They talk about different stuff. The daily is more in-depth and this one gives me a snapshot of current events.,5
What happened?,10/31/2018,Aimee c minard 23467884,Why are you guys advertising for the conservative Wall Street Journal and then interviewing people who say we shouldn‚Äôt trust women?? NOT FAIR AND BALANCED NEWS! And not what I signed up for. Unsubscribe.,2

A great addition to my morning,11/03/2018,Missycsiha,I listen to this in the morning at work in conjunction with other podcasts. I like this one because I know I can get the highlights in a very simple and straightforward way. To compare it to other news podcasts is not fair.

Underwhelmed,08/24/2018,betsynation,"I‚Äôve been listening to Up First since February 2018 and I‚Äôve come to realize the reporting isn‚Äôt always balanced and from what I perceive, they report in favor of their opinions or stance, not moderately. The Molly Tibbetts murder was never even brought up by one of the four main hosts, it took one of the political NPR reporters they regularly bring on for insight. The part the main hosts did talk about was of course border patrol and how Trump wants to control it. But if there‚Äôs a scandal in the Catholic Church it won‚Äôt be missed on their lineup. Anything to do with Trump, against Trump, scandals... can‚Äôt it be all news headlines, not just one side of it or what this crew deems as newsworthy? I really do like the podcast personalities but I‚Äôve just been disappointed a few too many times. Looking for a podcast that more openly reports the news.",3
No infomercials with my news!,08/24/2018,Nhtrdswryuibdsetuikbvcd,"I love this podcast and listen every day, but the last few days have included a 1.5 minute capital one infomercial. I don't mind ads, but that's excessive and it feels like it's being presented as news, which feels dishonest.",1

The perfect way to start each day,08/27/2018,clayschumacher,"This show has become as much a part of my mornings as my coffee.

Amazing,08/28/2018,Ladycakes13,"Excellent podcast, I listen to it while I eat breakfast in the morning. The hosts are charming, funny, but also are great at their jobs. If there was a full length morning edition podcast, I would listen to it!",5
Listen every morning,08/28/2018,Briman024,Soooo much better than the whining on CNN,5
Pretty low level journalism,08/28/2018,Samriver,"This podcast spends too much time reporting on inane things. On the Monday after hurricane lane dumped like 46 inches of rain in Hawaii (way more than was anticipated) the episode of this series spend at least 3-4 minutes talking about John McCains honorary memorial service and didn‚Äôt even mention that the hurricane had past and what the crazy rainfall had done... a simple mention of the tragedy and memorial service would have done fine but they got into detail, sensationalizing his death. To me this says that their priority is not to deliver important information, but to serve as a political tabloid.",2

Steve Inskeep,09/01/2018,TT1954,I listen to Up First and the Daily with Michael Babaro every weekday before I listen to the other Podcasts. For a long time I have been thinking about the journalists on Up First. I like David Green and Rachel Martin. Steve Inskeep's reporting and interviewing seems outdated.

Nearly perfect‚Äîsummer changes not so good,08/21/2018,mcgharry,"3-4 stars: I‚Äôve loved this podcast for a long time, but some hosting changes over the summer have made shows feel not as seamless as before, and I hope the new little cutesy pre-show intros will go away.

Mostly accurate news,08/16/2018,Chris Pettiet,"Stories are mostly accurate unless they‚Äôre reporting on politics. They do what all of the major news companies do which is leave out key facts. For example, they reported on John Brennan losing his security clearance and made it sound like it was purely retaliatory while failing to mention he leaked the Fusion GPS dossier to the press and used it to help the FBI get a FISA warrant and open the Russian Investigation. The dossier was paid for by the DNC and obtained info by paying Russian Intelligence Agents! They didn‚Äôt think this had anything to do with why he lost his security clearance!",2

UpFirst Daily Listener,08/20/2018,Docta T,"I listen every morning, and almost always feel more informed and confident about having a grasp on the days news. However, not even UpFirst is immune to our 24/7 coverage cycles, so occasionally they will cover the same topic an entire week in a row, when realistically they only know as much information as could fill one segment. UpFirst does do a nice job of trying to bring in international stories, and it would be nice to see some of these get more airtime than the endless coverage on the Mueller investigation.",5
Not bad..,08/20/2018,NeoElement,"Like most NPR-associated content, it smacks of liberal bias.. but it‚Äôs generally tolerable. The format is quick, and coverage isn‚Äôt bad.",4

Bias Beware,08/07/2018,xxxxxrated,"While it would be most appropriate to NOT hear any bias during this news report, sadly the undertone and sometimes the blatant tone is quite opposed to President Trump.

"Used to be fairly balanced, now biased",07/17/2018,Ianfkirby,"There certainly is a liberal bias to NPR reporting. I‚Äôve listened to NPR 4-6 hours a day for years and of that there is no doubt.

When a service is almost a disservice,07/24/2018,Astationzero,I was very excited for this show after listing to NPR Politics throughout 2016. After a few months I got burnt out.

Again, today I tried; I listened to NPR‚Äôs Up First podcast for July 23rd of 2018. And again, I was wholly disappointed. In their coverage of President Trump‚Äôs tweet responding to a speech given by the President of Iran the day before, they neglected to share an important statement in that speech, specifically that peace with Iran would be the mother of all peace, and only reported what followed, that war with Iran would be a mother of all wars. The reporter also refused to share the entire tweet by Trump, one of his usual, ‚Äòthreats like no other‚Äô tweets. Furthermore, not 5 minutes later, their coverage of the FISA authorized wiretapping of Carter Page, neglected to reference the recorded interview where Page, in his own words, said he had acted on behalf of Russian government officials in 2013. Rather, the reporter focused on the validity of the Steele dossier and its use in the FISA court as a premise for the authorization of said wiretapping.",1

I think NPR has the best view on progressive issues. Thanks for keeping this on and I hope to keep listening.",4
My go-to news source.,07/09/2018,almcd23,"I LOVE this podcast. In a world where we're constantly bombarded by sensationalist takes on current events, it's so refreshing to be able to turn this on and actually receive the facts about the goings-on of the world. I'm a daily listener and this is my favorite way to stay informed. Thank you, NPR!",5
Leaving the Podcast,07/10/2018,mmg921,"I have to say that Ive been highly disappointed on this podcast for the past few months. After listening to it for about a year, they have now mainly shifted their focus on political news, although they can hardly be blamed for being the only news organization for doing so. There are more relevant news beyond our President‚Äôs latest tweet.....",2
Good for busy people,07/11/2018,Patrick C M,"As a student, it‚Äôs tough to keep up with the news effectively when there‚Äôs always something to do. This podcast is super helpful in letting me keep up with the key news and not sacrificing much valuable time",5

Less Objective Than I Was Hoping For,07/12/2018,wiator,"This was my first adult attempt at regularly consuming news. For over a decade I‚Äôd avoided it all, but this seemed like a manageable amount to get through, and NPR is apparently considered more or less ‚Äúcenter‚Äù politically.",3

Generally good reporting with left leaning slant,07/13/2018,Mevans87,"NPR has a long history of quality reporting and journalistic excellence. The Up First Podcast continues that tradition. Unsurprisingly, it also continues the tradition of left leaning perspectives. Frequent use of left-leaning talking points, word choice, and subtle editorializations can at times make the podcast a bit grating to listen to unless of course you happen to subscribe to an ideology more congruent with the reporting supplied.",3
One complaint,07/13/2018,ghostface,This is a good podcast. But the intro music is so annoying. It‚Äôs just such a jarring sound to hear in the morning. Please consider changing it.,4

Extremely left biased,06/23/2018,love NYyankees,"over-emotional, dramatic. I just want news.",1
Concerned with the bias,06/23/2018,cr186783,I love this podcast but lately the bias commentary is being ramped up. I enjoy the non political news and my hope is NPR will take a more neutral position on the political news.,4

Leftist Political Inbreeding,06/25/2018,Fruita Father of 6,"Digital media leftist rag so heavily populated by liberal, progressive and democrat staff they are simply unable to provide fair framing and proper context to their coverage. So blinded by their bias they are handicapped from providing critique of any democrat. However, their inbred political bent instinctively finds every possible way to find flaw and blame any republican. Sad, because I think they actually are doing this subconsciously in many cases. I gave it two stars because it is well produced.",2
No longer a News Summary Show,06/26/2018,PodcastAudience,This podcast used to be my favorite. Unfortunately overtime what used to be a summary of all events happening it‚Äôs now one Trump issue argued for 10 minutes. I wish this was the news show it‚Äôs promised to be. I like that original concept more. The world could use a summary not the 2 topic argumentative political policy show it‚Äôs become. Un-subscribed,1

Perfect dose of news,06/28/2018,ascleary,"Listening to news these days is hard and depressing. This is the perfect amount of information in the morning to be able to keep track of what‚Äôs going on without having to dwell on it all day. Unbiased, cut-to-the-chase, quality reporting.",5

Newcomer to news,06/30/2018,all nick names are takennn,"At first this podcast was exactly what I wanted, quick news on the top stories. However, after listening to the podcast for almost a year, and expanding my horizons to other news podcasts, I now realize how absurdly biased this podcast is. I unsubscribed from NPR politics after two months cause I couldn‚Äôt handle the blatant anti-conservative remarks. And now, I can‚Äôt handle the annoying giggles and sarcastic remarks from this podcast. Especially from the female host. I really did enjoy the podcast in the beginning, but as I became more versed in politics I realized I need a news source that focuses more on the facts. Dominico does an excellent job trying to hide his bias, but the female host does not even try.",2
Succinct and informative,07/01/2018,open mind in Georgia,"It was one of the first podcasts I tried, for a brief overview for the day. I have not been disappointed, and it continues to be within the standard of NPR.

No liberal bias,06/19/2018,mEOwMicks,"To the other review who didn‚Äôt like the tone of the reporters, get over yourself. Journalists are people, too; do you expect them to jump for joy at reading policies they find disquieting? Perhaps the real issue is you‚Äîturn up the volume on your headphones and maybe it will quell the (cognitive) dissonance in your head.",5
In-depth info in a timely fashion,06/20/2018,D Ardito,This podcast provides detailed coverage of important news. It offers just the right amount.,5
Is it me?,06/20/2018,Backwoods TJ,So last night the US pulled out of the UN. Usually you run a special episode when the crazy things happen or at least mention them.

Just Enough,06/20/2018,San Miguel to Sacramento,"As a long time NPR listener, I depend on you for news.

Several of my colleagues admit to feeling ‚Äúsick‚Äù when listening to the disturbing direction our country is headed.

Very liberal bias,06/18/2018,Thanos 2018,This program should be one of the few journalistic sources to be nonpartisan but it clearly has a liberal bias. The tone of the announcers when describing policies typically has a condescending tone or an obvious sigh/pitch of voice change. When describing liberal policies and/or Democrat agendas the voice changes‚Äîmost notably from the female anchor.,1

Programming overlaps with Morning Edition,05/25/2018,Brynniesan,"I love this podcast, it is a great start to the day! David, Steve, and Rachel feel like members of my family.

I know that efficiency is probably of the essence at the time of day when stories are recorded but....verbatim?",4
May 26 BONUS episode is a scam,05/26/2018,‚Äòlike',"Love Up First overall, but Rachel Martin previews this episode as Gene Friedman speaking about Michael Cohen with ""remarkable candor"".

"Daily news, daily Trump",06/04/2018,ABado618,"At first I loved this podcast. It‚Äôs short, to the point, and provides a good summary of national and international news. However, after listening daily, I‚Äôve become jaded with their daily focus on Trump. Even on this concise show, all national news is turned toward the White House, and every move by Trump is scrutinized. It‚Äôs exhausting. Now, I‚Äôm not a daily listener, but I expect to hear at least one story focused on Trump each day.

Un Biased?,05/10/2018,Pee Dee Tee,"In my never ending quest to find a news outlet that reports the facts at there factual base without presenting either a left or right bias, this outlet is not it. Many of the journalists are able to report the facts and although their bias is present, they do a good job letting the audience know what is their opinion and what is fact, which is why I listen. They are generally left leaning but not in your face leftist. There are a couple of journalists, however, who unashamedly present their opinion as fact. The one who I nearly always have to jump ahead when they come on is Mara Liasson. If you can handle her unabashedly presenting her leftist opinion as fact, the rest of the podcast is pretty decent.",3

Agendas,05/15/2018,NordoftheRings,"I've not always enjoyed listening but I've wanted to hear all point of views including the left. However, today was the last straw after over two year listening. Israel is defending it borders from Hamas and what does it have to say? Hamas ""refugees"" were forced from thier land 70 years ago. No they weren't. Everyone living in the Israeli borders at the time Israel became a nation was welcome to stay as an Israeli citizen. Many did. Many didn't. Once again Israel is painted at the bad guys. Not to mention the poor Trump coverage. We never hear anything about what our president is actually doing. Only how the scandels are developing and who is investigating who. This isn't even news anymore. Its the left agenda and propaganda. Our National Public Radio only covers half the nation. No more UpFirst for me.",1
Quick news update,05/16/2018,missmqc,This quick news fix is perfect for my attention span. I feel up-to-date on some of the most important headlines by listening to it. My only complaint is that the people on the show do not sound as sober and serious as other NPR reporters on other shows. The ‚ÄúMorning Latte‚Äù type chit chat makes the reporting seem less serious to me. I don‚Äôt want to know that you‚Äôre excited for the weekend! 52 people just got killed or whatever!,4

Good for news ‚Äî not great for podcasts,05/17/2018,Naganataka,"Default setting is the latest national news. A frustrating way to listen to podcasts. Doesn‚Äôt carry as large a selection of shows as other platforms. Often won‚Äôt save your place if you hit pause, so you have to go back, select the podcast and episode again, and try to find the spot you left off. Doesn‚Äôt automatically play new episodes of subscribed podcasts, but instead auto-plays random content that their algorithm thinks you might like. Sometimes won‚Äôt display saved shows in your feed after you hit ‚Äòsubscribe‚Äô ‚Äî you have to search out the show from the library each time.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is Steve Inskeep - one of the hosts. For some reason I just don‚Äôt like his style. I think it‚Äôs because he pretends to be surprised by what the reporter tells him and it‚Äôs just so obviously disingenuous. I realize this is a totally personal thing but I just can‚Äôt take it! Other than that, this is excellent.",4
A wonderful way to fill in the gaps,05/08/2018,Honestlycme,I rely on this podcast to give me a quick recap of what's going on back in the states. Living abroad you just miss certain nuanced takes on the news so this fills in the gaps for me from a reliable source. Good idea NPR!,5

Repetitive,04/17/2018,Lauren Chev,I started listening to this podcast a few months ago and since then it has become more and more repetitive. Today is the third podcast in a row with the same topic of Comey who is a private citizen on a book tour with no original information. It‚Äôs basically an ad campaign for his book.

More realistically she was a terrible human being who was biggoted and small minded. Wed April 18 2018 you spend four minutes talking about her, and the terrible loss that is her death. Then, as an after thought, you have a thirty second blurb about Carl Kassel, a beloved journalist, anouncer from WWDTM, and generally awesome person, who also died. It's bad enough that most of the internet seems to care more that Bush died, but Kassel was one of your own. For shame NPR.",5

They make a lot of jokes that sound incredibly like bullying comments. It‚Äôs definitely not an attitude I would want to start my day with, but I do listen to it around lunchtime when I‚Äôve already established my pace for the day.

Quality as expected from NPR,03/26/2018,Jimpkkjhfss,"A good in-depth quality podcast that one would expect from NPR. Journalism with really strong fundamentals. They certainly do have a view though, and it is definitely left of spectrum. Although it is readily apparent in most cases that they try to offer more than just that side of an argument. It‚Äôs mostly on social issues where they have the biggest problem with being objective; that‚Äôs when their viewpoint becomes much more one-sided. But again all in all very good journalism and mostly objective. Although their viewpoint is readily apparent, they haven‚Äôt let themselves be pushed over the edge like so many other good journalism organizations have with the Trump presidency.",3

Meh,03/02/2018,drSm.d.,"‚ÄúUp First‚Äù is brief, blatantly biased and much too incomplete for a daily news review. Reporters and journalists are subpar.

Color commentary...,03/05/2018,NoticinginNebraska,Too often I listen to this program to get a quick update on the news only to find myself disgusted by the ‚Äúohs‚Äù and ‚Äúahh‚Äù that are in response to the news. In addition commentators often cross the line by openly vocalizing their bias and opinions in a way clearly intended to create an emotional response. This is not what I expect from an NPR product and hope there will be some moderation of personal interjections in the future.,2

Best 10 minutes of my day,02/18/2018,T-Lur,Thanks for the very concise but very informative ten minutes to news...listen every morning as soon as I get in my car...Love it...great work folks!,5
Biased and unprofessional,02/19/2018,max_ayerbe,I have lost quite a bit of respect for NPR. I have been a listener and supporter for many years but now I am having my doubts about their integrity. You don‚Äôt have to like the current administration but your listeners are expecting unbiased news. That is not what you are providing with this podcast. For example why not cover the FBI text messages and the controversy at the FBIs involvement in the election? One of the most unfortunate outcomes from this administration is it has forced Americans to question their source of news.,1
Used to love,02/20/2018,Skipico7,Loved this show until they decided to part from the news to devote entire episodes to a one sided debate on guns.,1
It‚Äôs 13-15 mins,02/20/2018,lamy87,"Generally in 13 minutes they manage to give you the important headlines which is what I want! However during some events they harp on one issue the entire episode or for several episodes. For example: the Florida shooting, the Russian investigation after the memo released, the Las Vegas shooting. Fed up with their biased coverage of the news 80% of the time it‚Äôs great but the other episodes are so irritating I am unsubscribing. Anyone have a better suggestion?",2
Nice news summary to start the day,02/20/2018,Jules-A-F,This is a nice summary of what's happened in the past 24 hours and what's coming up today. I always know if I want more details I can go to Morning Edition.,4
10 Minutes Of Quality News,02/20/2018,MarkDillonVO,"I enjoy NPR. They lean a bit to the left, and for the most part I prefer that, but they do listen to the view of the right so I feel it‚Äôs more balanced than most.",5
Best podcast ever,02/20/2018,jw_637,"All the news I need to know in quick snackable bites. Easy to follow, easy to understand. Never felt more up to date with every day news. Thank you NPR!!",5
My favorite ten minutes every morning,02/21/2018,GatorRunner,"I adore this podcast. I‚Äôve always loved Steve, David and Rachel and they don‚Äôt disappoint with this podcast! All my important news in one quick podcast, every day - plus I love the little personal dialogue intros they‚Äôve started doing, shows us a bit more of our 3 favorite morning news hosts!",5
Ev-uh-ry Day!,02/21/2018,Techtistic,I‚Äôve been listening to Up First since it was released. It‚Äôs been essential to me staying in the know on essential news. I enjoy the show and recommend it to others. My partner and I discuss the topics and laugh at Steve Inkeep‚Äôs antics.,5
Steve Inskeep Whining for 15 Minutes,02/21/2018,GregZero,Featured in this episode: Steve Inskeep whines and bellyaches for 15 minutes. Also fortified with 100% of your daily allowance of smug journalism.,5
Big fan,02/21/2018,BobbyHTFD,"I've subscribed to Up First since its inception and continue to listen to this day. I'm a fan of straight reporting and Steve, Tamara, David and others deliver the news with no bias. They pick out a handful of news items and cover them as well as they can in 12-15 minutes. It is very succinct and they are even able to get guests in there for relevant info. I work in media relations and follow the news and this is one of the first sources I go to in the morning to see what people are talking about.",5
Fantastic,02/21/2018,Nrogner596,I listen to this podcast every single morning. It keeps me up to date and it‚Äôs perfect if you want to stay updated on politics.,5
Quick & Comprehensive News!,02/22/2018,Foodluvver,The first thing I do every morning is put on Up First. It's the perfect way for me to get up-to-speed on what's going on in the news. The broadcasters are intelligent and their consicise summary of dense topics is invaluable heading into my day. I love this podcast so much!,5
Good but too casual,02/23/2018,ForABettePlanet,"I rely on short podcasts like this to brief myself while on the go. NPR has always been a great source for news and entertainment for me. However, I find the tone of interaction between the journalists/newscasters to be too casual and sometimes sarcastic or goofy. This is off-putting. If I want news commentary, I‚Äôll go somewhere else for that. I just want the news delivered appropriately and objectively to the point without someone else‚Äôs underlying input, or personal comments about themselves. This is atypical of NPR news delivery and I hope they will change back to more professional delivery soon before I find another source to replace them.",3
Listen every morning,02/05/2018,mck10101,Great way to quickly catch up on the day's news and stay informed. This is the first thing I listen to every day.,5
Amazing!,02/05/2018,Tpaczko,"Perfect daily morning podcast. The two great hosts cover the most important headlines in under 20 minutes.

The Go2News,02/08/2018,Go2Guys,"Never been one to listen or watch new stations. Never believe for most the information being accurate
felt it was just story say what the new is. Up First give you most current world new tell you what the new is. this is why its the first thing. I now listen to in the mornig.",5
Perfect way to stay up to date,02/08/2018,Malcolm Wolf,This podcast is the perfect length to stay informed on a daily basis. I listen every morning.,5

Brief and best way to start my day,02/08/2018,fleur907,I like the focus on 3 key stories each day. Thank you!,5
Perfect for my commute,02/08/2018,shejustlaughs,"I‚Äôm on an irregular schedule and don‚Äôt wake up at the same time every day, so it was hard to get my NPR news in a consistent way ‚Äî until this podcast came along. And at 13min long, it just happens to be the exact length of my walk to work.",5

Great to start your commute with,02/09/2018,Max Caddison,Great to listen to on my morning commute. Pleasant voices to listen to. They have a broad enough reach to have guests who are actively covering areas that come up so they are familiar with the matter and can give context. Short little ad break that doesn‚Äôt bother me much given that it supports such a broad coverage of news around the world.,5
A part of my morning routine,02/09/2018,hdt13,Love having this bite-sized podcast to keep me up to date on the news. It‚Äôs quickly become a part of my routine each morning.,5

Best Start to the Day,02/11/2018,Chelaryxian,"This is the best way to start your morning commute or for a background to your breakfast. The NPR crew do a fast, no fluff breakdown of the world events, with a little of their humor thrown in and some great correspondents.",5

A great way to start the day,01/24/2018,tw02320,"David Greene and Steve Inskeep are phenomenal hosts for this podcast , and the whole NPR staff is on point. I appreciate the staffs‚Äô objective journalism and healthy skepticism. I listen to Up First and The Daily (New York Times news podcast - also recommended) most days for my news updates, and I particularly appreciate Up First for its levity and relative lightheartedness.",5

Always start my day with Up First,01/25/2018,krober92,"I listen to this podcast every morning while I‚Äôm getting ready for work, and I absolutely love it.

Bias,01/26/2018,@scottykummer,"If you want to be news, stick to news. Giggling and mocking President Trump lost me. I don‚Äôt like him either, but your bias is showing.",2

Continued Connection,01/28/2018,Steev Why,"Having young kids often makes folks say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember anything from X year to Y year.‚Äù No longer. I have listened to Up First for my toddler‚Äôs whole life, and I feel as informed as before kids‚Äîless rested, but equally informed.",5
Indeed it is!,01/28/2018,Trystgirl,"This is a perfectly named podcast. It has the exact effect I'm sure was intended when named, as I always listen to this one first. Given the news these days, I often groan or sigh, which isn't the best way to start a day, but there it is. Good stuff.",5
Great way to start the morning,01/29/2018,Shernandez0390,"I‚Äôve incorporated listening to this podcast to my morning routine, listening during my 10-minute walk to work.

It‚Äôs own podcast; different than The Daily,01/30/2018,ericamichell12,"Up First is great. Quick, snackable preview of the day‚Äôs news without getting too in-depth. Definitely a different approach than The Daily. I listen to both and find they are both beneficial in different ways.",5

Pairs best with coffee,01/31/2018,lswan16,I listen every morning! I love that I can catch up for the day while getting ready for work.,5
Very Disappointing,01/16/2018,Disappointed in UpFirst,"Great idea poorly executed. Fails to effectively meet the niche of expanding on the hourly newscast. The flippant, sometimes unprofessional reporters, don‚Äôt do justice the news.",1
Love,01/16/2018,Jmb814WI,I love getting the daily spinners of news and analysis from this podcast!,5
Best way to get what you need to know QUICKLY!,01/18/2018,JKUVA,I listen to this podcast every day on my way to work. 10-12 minutes that gets you up to date quickly. I listen to other longer podcasts to go more in depth into issues of the day but this one is great and about the only one I actually get to listen to every day. Thanks NPR!!!,5
My morning habit,01/18/2018,Vawfeona,I love listening to this podcast in the morning. It gives me all the news headlines that I need to know in the time that it takes me to get ready in the morning. I love this podcast and I‚Äôll continue to listen every day it‚Äôs on!,5

Great except for the liberal bias!,01/19/2018,michiganandy,This is a quality podcast but they are apparently incapable of producing material without ‚Äútaking a side.‚Äù When they do this it really discredits them as a fair source of media. Would be 5 stars if they could just leave out the bias!,2
Thanks for the early morning briefing,01/19/2018,Little SAR,The perfect morning briefing to get my morning started.,5
Thanks!,01/19/2018,Forsie1,You all are with me every morning as I walk to the train. Makes the bitter Chicago cold more tolerable. Thanks for that and starting off my day with the latest news.,5
Good Daily Catch-Up,01/20/2018,trikeman,Up First is a great way to start my day caught up on news in a bite-size fashion.,4
First thing I listen to in the morning.,01/20/2018,Aqu05,"NPR has been my favorite news source for a few years now, and I appreciate listening to this quick summary of some of the most pressing info of the week while waking up to finish some work and drinking my coffee. Thank you!",5
I Miss It on the Weekends,01/20/2018,thesuperalice,"This has become part of my morning rotation of brief news podcasts. My 5-minute highlights from various stations hit the high points, but this digs a bit deeper into a couple issues each day so that I feel a bit more informed. The exchanges between the anchors and the specialists or reporters-in-the-field often give a couple different perspectives, helping us question certain knee-jerk biases in this increasingly polarized political environment. I wish this were available on weekends, too!",5
Maybe make a change in xenophobic language?,01/20/2018,Ricardeux,"It would not only be greatly appreciated, but definitely helpful if instead of referring to people as ""coming in illegally"", for example, they said ""came in without documents"". No group of people is illegal, as saying so only enforces a xenophobic and oppressive mindset. I would think that NPR would have made the choice in language from the beginning.",1
"Good, however...",01/22/2018,XIXIILXXXI,"This is a good news feed, however, since its creation it‚Äôs starting to present a biased opinion based undertone. I‚Äôm neither democratic, republican, or green. I like and dislike areas of each party. I prefer fact based news presented in un-opinionated tones to allow me the ability to think for myself. Lately this is lacking. Furthermore, they‚Äôve begun to add sports comments and that‚Äôs disappointing. In a world consumed with sports I‚Äôd like one need resource that omits them.",3
Great way to start the day,01/22/2018,DmartCFSyracuse,Awesome quick news update for my daily commute.,5
Glass Half Full,01/22/2018,jaymerrill,"Over the past several months I listened to this podcast nearly every morning on my way to work. While it presents a variety of topics, I began to notice a lack of neutrality. They are constantly (subtly) bashing our government, and though I can see in many cases that is justified, we need some realistic positivity or at least laying off that aspect of news a little bit.",3

Jan 24 2018 poor Reporting on #releasethememo,01/24/2018,NeonColorFan,Major omission - Russian Bots amplifying and promoting this partisan hit piece on FBI investigation. Senate calls for investigation into Russian info warfare. Sloppy and incomplete.,2
Great commute update,01/02/2018,zakelo52,It‚Äôs great to have a narrow summary of some of the big ticket items that happen every day. Makes for a great update during my commute.,5
It‚Äôs okay,01/02/2018,Jade0782,I have to admit I want the news but without the biased opinion... it would make this nicer. You can tell where the people in this show side with... and it just doesn‚Äôt give them much credit to their reporting. I‚Äôm not sure why it can‚Äôt just be straight to the point on what is going on rather than hearing their feed back and opinion?,3
Quick Updates!,01/02/2018,TurtleStride,I love having access to the major on-going‚Äôs of the United States and the world. You dig deep enough so we can truly understand but keep short enough to keep it in our minds and for us to follow up on our own! Thank you!,5

Less Steve wold be better,01/11/2018,Nerkgreg,"Love this podcast for its concise summary. Only minor quibble is Steve Inskeep‚Äôs verbosity. Questions for reporters tend to ramble, and Rachel Martin often is barely heard from at all.",4

Informative and Efficient,12/09/2017,Sweemour Toddbourn,"I listen to this podcast every weekday morning and it always gets me ready for any discussions of current events that come up over the course of the day. They cover the important headlines with enough depth and that you get a good understanding of what the stories about, but quickly enough that each episode stays under 15 minutes.

NPR‚Äôs Up First is my favorite podcast because I have just enough time on my commute from home to school or work in the morning to listen to this and get a compact overview of what‚Äôs going on nationally and internationally.

Disappointed,12/01/2017,notredame09,"In this morning's episode, at 4:30, Rachel Martin laughed derisvely at views present by House Republicans on the tax bill. I genuinely love this podcast as a part of my daily commute, and have enjoyed listening to it every morning, but that laugh indicated to me a level of condesension towards elected officials and the people who support them that really ruined my morning. At NPR, you have an opportunity to be a force of reason in our country. Part of your founder's vision for NPR is to ""regard the individual differences among men with respect and joy rather than derision and hate."" This morning there was enough derision to make a well-educated loyal listener turn the radio off. Please don't let your personal views and the views of those around you affect your reporting and alienate half the country. Please don't add to the poisonous amount of polarization and division in our hurting nation. You have the opportunity to bring us together as an informed electorate, and this morning you couldn't help but laugh dismissively at the majority of our elected officials. Please be better. Your content is usually outstanding.",1

Not as good as The Daily,11/20/2017,Iluvsputnik,"NPR‚Äôs Up First is not as good as The Daily, but I enjoy how NPR packs in a few important news updates in a very short podcast. Okay to listen to once I‚Äôve finished The Daily.",2

Hmm how ironic,11/22/2017,PaintingAway,"I love this podcast, but just wanted to point out how funny it was this morning that we all heard an ad for Lyft minutes before we heard about Uber covering up their breach. I‚Äôm sure NPR is independent, but maybe another ad would‚Äôve been a smarter choice this morning?",4
Listen Every Day,11/22/2017,wastelandcompanion,"It's a good bite-size news podcast. There are a few out there, but stick with this. They don't get bogged down in any particular story, so it's great first thing in the morning.",5

An everyday staple,11/28/2017,erika_hansen,"I can‚Äôt rave about Up First enough. Every morning I start my day with two podcasts that keep me up to date with what‚Äôs going on - Up First by NPR and The Daily by the NYT. I saw a review that tried to compare the two, but in a way it feels like apples and oranges. I listen to Up First to get my 15 minute, clear and concise update on news headlines in context. The Daily dives deeper into one topic for ~20 minutes and then has a *super* brief headline update at the end. Up First is so easy to listen to and an absolute must in my day to keep up with news that often feels immense and intelligible.",5

Stop saying the names of the mass murderers,11/08/2017,chocoguitar,"This show is normally great, but there‚Äôs a big problem in the coverage of mass shootings. When you repeat the names of the shooter over and over, it makes them famous, and shows potential shooters around the country that if they murder innocent people, they can be famous too. Somebody like this shouldn‚Äôt have his name spread to thousands of people. In fact, an animal like him doesn‚Äôt even deserve a name.",3
Awesome,11/08/2017,Jaxstar27,‚ù§Ô∏è you guys!,5

Nice Pod.,11/09/2017,Berk Fam,Excellent podcast. Only minor gripe is that the stories are very brief. There are other outlets for longer form of course. But too often the reporting here seems hurried and only scratches the surface of what are otherwise well put together and thoughtful stories.,5
Too biased,11/09/2017,Pac12 all the way!,"It‚Äôs a shame they‚Äôre not more moderate :/

Some of their reporters are very good at being neutral but the main guys are very left which is annoying when you‚Äôre someone who just wants the facts of stories.",2
Every Morning,11/09/2017,Rob Sisco,"This podcast has become part of my routine every morning when I wake up. Topline information of the news of the day. Doesn't get too deep, doesn't get too political. Get the information and come to your own opinion. Great show.",5
Fantastic resource,10/24/2017,N0le,I‚Äôve listened to every one of these since they launched and each day I find it truly insightful.

Great Podcast For Morning Commute,10/25/2017,bull ball145,"This podcast is the perfect podcast for a short morning commute.

Perfect news show!,10/26/2017,TheMikeSpring,"I want to keep up with the news but I'm not always interested in listening to an hour-long show. This show is perfect for me, then. It's usually 10-13 minutes, and it gives us a brief but in-depth look at the 3 or 4 most important stories of each day. There's minimal bias, but I like that the hosts are straightforward yet don't come across like emotionless automatons. This is the best way I've found yet to keep up on the most important stories every single day. Love it!",5
Good program bad podcast app.,10/26/2017,SteveRPh,Good news report by NPR. This is a lousy app.It does not allow you to DELETE an episode from your phone completely. The title of old news stays on your phone hogging space in your memory.,1

News needs to be presented dispassionately,10/29/2017,BWV244,"Let me be clear. The podcast is good and a nice way to start the day. All too often, however, when talking about Trump and his ilk I hear a tone of disdain, disbelief, condescension... what else can I say? I actually agree but I am not a newscaster. The news should be presented dispassionately without giving listeners cause to complain of partisanship. When conservatives complain about the liberal bent of NPR, it‚Äôs all too easy to see why.",3
Catalonia Coverage,10/30/2017,Theoloricca,"Very disappointed about your coverage of the Catalonia issue, which was mostly based on the minority pro-independence, anti-democratic propaganda.",1

Liberal podcast,10/31/2017,Jwise-NH,"I listen to up first every morning, and I enjoy the way they deliver news to podcasts for consumers. The only issue I have is how they obviously lean to the left side of the political field. It would be 5 stars if they delivered true unbiased news.",2

Could be more pro,10/20/2017,joeytosi,I have been an NPR listener for 15 years. It‚Äôs quality information. But over the years I‚Äôve noticed an unprofessional subjective tone/narrative more overtly present in the news and podcasts. Especially the news with Steve Inskeep. He wears his politics on his sleeve. It‚Äôs a turnoff for the anchor to try and tell me how to feel about issues in the news. Keep it pro and just report without the colorful emotions seeping into the presentation. Otherwise it comes off as elitist smug choir-preaching.,3
Such a solid primer for my day,10/20/2017,mariepaix,Highly recommend,5
Need it,10/21/2017,Bloodblisters,Please keep it up. Hopefully we can make America smart again.,5

Too Biased,10/23/2017,StephanieBarney,"I like that there‚Äôs a news podcast that I can easily and quickly listen too, but I find myself getting frustrated every time I listen because the hosts or guests on the show are politically biased and this is very unnecessary. I understand that this is NPR‚Äôs show, but as a Democrat myself, but the snarky liberal remarks are infuriating. If the podcast begins to be avoid being biased soon, I will consider changing my review.",1
Missing news,10/24/2017,Rayshoots,I understand the uphill battle of covering news in such a small short amount of time. However. In the months I‚Äôve been listening to this. Nothing covered on Net Neutrality. Especially when it is on the docket to be killed on Thanksgiving this year. I would hope our news would cover it before nothing can be done for it,2

Questions not Answers,10/24/2017,AdcarTOW,"If the first thing I listen to in the morning is just a bunch of questions that ‚Äújournalists‚Äù are trying to find answers to, I start my day confused and without answers. Please report back when you‚Äôve done the task of gathering facts.",2

I was hoping for better,10/13/2017,Hyde06,I have been searching for a NON BIAS news podcast for some time now. It is very clear to me that this does not fit that bill. I am not a conservative or a liberal. I support neither the left or the right. I just want the news without spinning those stories to fit the networks views. Does such a thing exist? Not to my knowledge. I was really hoping for better is all..,1

True daily news overview...,10/09/2017,Mutzica,"Although this podcast and NYT‚Äôs the Daily are frequently compared side by side, they serve different purposes. NYT‚Äôs the Daily is more about in depth analysis of some aspect of a recent story that may or may not be related to the top stories that day. This podcast on the other hand is an overview of the top stories of the day with limited commentary. I prefer this podcast when I‚Äôm looking to get ‚Äòthe Daily‚Äô news roundup.",5

Not a Good Daily Digest of the News (As Promised),10/13/2017,Alex Monea,"When this podcast first came out I was very excited about the idea. I was hoping to be able to touch base with the world each morning and get a roundup of the what I needed to know, a digested version of the entire paper that I usually don't have time to make it beyond the first section.",2
Poor commentary and too general,10/03/2017,Anj1618,"The length of the podcast is definitely limiting. Other daily news podcasts like BBC Global News Podcast are much more in depth and cover all sides of a headline. The duration of the podcast is surely convenient, but it's shallow and lacks variety and focus. Also some insensitive commentary. For example, when describing the post-hurricane situation in Puerto Rico, they referred to the people in the streets as doing ""urban-camping."" These people have nothing and have no choice but to live in shelters and on the streets. Portraying this desperation as ""camping"" neglects the harsh reality of the situation. Headlines are usually America-centered and it takes a few days for them to report the goings-on of other countries like the racial-cleansing in Myanmar and the Catalan referendum in Spain. Overall, would not recommend for anyone who wants more than a shallow view of American news.",2

I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve let Rachel Martin take the reins - when Steve was hosting every day, it was a countdown to someone getting interrupted for no reason. Great update podcast overall.",5
Good for the daily catch up,10/04/2017,heatherec0503,"I listen to this in the morning while putting on my make up. It keeps me informed in the perfect capsule of 15 minutes or less, and then I‚Äôm ready to go more in depth with the issues when the NPR politics podcasts come out that week.",5
Wouldn‚Äôt start my morning any other way,10/04/2017,Mia Mundy,Thank you for presenting current events and news in a 21st century digestible format. Means more than you will ever know.,5
Unsub,10/04/2017,Gggggg more,"I realize there isn‚Äôt a terrible amount you can be expected to do with a 10 min news cast, but setting your bar at zero new info proliferation and zero new idea generation is too low to maintain my interest. Simply giving people more of what they want, and stretching 10 seconds of news to span 10 minutes doesn‚Äôt educate anyone. It does make a good echo chamber though.",1

Wish it went farther,09/26/2017,GMN27701,"I love me some NPR. And I do learn things from this podcast. But more often than not, it's just a re-hash of what I already have heard on NPR, seen on the NYT homepage, or have otherwise already become aware of just through being a news-hungry type. I don't understand what niche they're filling here. Maybe it's people who listen to or read little else, in which case this is at least a leg up. But every time I listen, I get annoyed at how long the intro and outros are. They spend so much time telling me what they're going to be telling me, and then there's little time spent on going into any depth. I want added content and context, not brevity.

Up first as well as the Daily form the New York times has become part of my daily routine. One is not better than the other and each has its own flavor.

Quick and concise but Trump news gets precedence,09/14/2017,KS4640,"I have been enjoying this podcast for a while now and greatly appreciate the concise synopsis of the days news. Unfortunately, it's upsetting at times how any news of Trumps daily ridiculousness gets all the attention. Yesterday there was a deadly shooting at a high school in Washington that was never mentioned on the show, instead they went over details of yet another one of Trumps dinners. I'll stick around hoping for more balance in the future.",4
I never write a review but...,09/14/2017,DOtheDew81,"People are going to listen to whatever they want to listen to so whoever reads this, please do not think I am advertising. I want to live in a world of free-thinkers that are willing to hear all sides of an arguement.

Short but Informative,09/14/2017,ColorStoryFun,This great podcast offers a quick run down on the headlines of the day. I listen to this podcast every morning along with NYT's The Daily. In combination I feel I get a great grasp of current events for the day.,5

Great way to stay connected,09/06/2017,Bangkok Lauren,"I recently moved abroad and up first has been a great way to stay connected with what's going on back at home.

But overall it does the job, keeps you knowledgeable with important news information.",4
Axe Mary Louise Kelley,09/07/2017,Sigmafunlawbro,"Mary Louise Kelley sounds like she has egg yolk dangling from her vocal chords. She is obnoxious and her political views are not well veiled.

Great way to start the day!,09/08/2017,AssociatorExtraordinaire,"As someone who struggles to keep up with news this podcast is a godsend.

"If I don't wake to this podcast, I don't want to wake up!",09/08/2017,Sea monster 3,I wake at 5 a.m. Central so I can hear this podcast which is posted at 6 a.m. Eastern. It primes my day by informing me as to what has happened while I was sleeping and what is yet to come. I now need it as much as my morning cups of coffee. Keep it up and consider expanding to include weekends.,5
The Daily is better!,09/09/2017,Njinnj,"I love NPR but this podcast just doesn't make the grade. It insults my intelligence by assuming I don't know even basic facts about how government works and wastes my time with the hosts' lame attempts to be funny and entertaining. On the other hand, The Daily gives me the important news of the day succinctly and professionally.

Listen every morning,09/03/2017,Csmb4692,"At first it had too much US/Trump news, and I still think there could be more international coverage, but it's gotten a lot better, and I just really like the tone and pace. It's so short that you can always listen to another podcast for more depth/variety",5
"Nice length, unfortunate tone",09/03/2017,Aweberman,"I started listening to the show right from the first episode

I like the length of the show; they strive to keep it right at the 10 minute mark (if you don't count the ads). I actually wish they would do it less as an interview show and more as just a report. This is always the thing I don't care for with national news programs: their need to package everything into just a few minutes. (It's why I stay away from the morning network TV programs, too.) It makes the whole thing feel rushed when trying to have an interview last for only 3 minutes.",3

Just not good.,09/04/2017,Lito hop,"I feel pandered to. Very obviously a copycat show of the Daily, but not done half as well. At the end they do this self advertising bit that is really tacky.

Great,09/04/2017,conjurme,It's a nice quick daily news summary,5
OK,09/04/2017,Podcast Snobbery,"Not a bad idea. However, execution is poor. Podcast feels to pander to Millennials with all the tropes of new media: hip lingo, loose facts / speculation, and an obsession with framing everything relative to today's political lens.

Impressed w/ UP FIRST,09/05/2017,Carmentwist,Up First has become an integral part of my daily routine. I am always impressed with the detailed and informative reporting of this Daily podcast. Thank you for delivering a top notched program and getting up sooooo early to do it ;),5

Part of my morning routine,09/06/2017,RabOh13,"This podcast is exactly what it's meant to be - a run down of the biggest news stories of the day. People on here bashing that there were a couple of instances of pop culture references (which almost never happen to be honest)...I find that to be a bit snobby & closed minded; pop culture influences our world & vice versa.

Just what I needed.,08/31/2017,eloisacp07,"I'm a college student and am constantly on the go, sitting down to read a newspaper or reading the news online is a luxury and sadly a luxury I cannot have. NPR does such a great job at making news accessible while on the go. I love it!",5

I can listen to it while cooking breakfast or folding laundry, and I know I'll get the day's top stories before I leave the house in the morning.

Great Morning News,08/28/2017,NATO Poppins,I think NPR heard your cries because I have not heard any pop culture info. In fact at the end of the episode they advertise their pop culture show.

Liberal propaganda,08/28/2017,Spence Mc,"I was hoping to have a succinct source of information from a relative objective source.

Sometimes great! Sometimes iffy. Always horrendous music.,08/24/2017,baileyzallek,"The content can be great or questionable (depending on the day), but the worst part by far is the music. WHY does it have to sound like the morning announcements from ""Grease""??",2
Good daily news update,08/24/2017,cchamlin,"Journalists I know and trust with thoughtful discussion of current issues. Only gripe: get a different tag line. I don't ""need"" this to ""start my day"", I'm not an addict. I feel a little insulted every time I hear that.",5
I like it but...,08/24/2017,cil9mxm,....pls report only pertinent news. Don't care to know what some celebrities are doing.,4
A great show ruined,08/24/2017,Raeusredeemed,"Up first used to be a great source and f daily news. Now, it is a daily recounting of the reasons people are upset with President Trump. There are far more important national and international news stories to cover. Providing a continuous platform for dissent of Trump is hardly unbiased.",2

Hard to find unbiased journalism,08/26/2017,Felixmlks,"I started listening to this pod excited to hear a bit more about the news of the day. However, the slant the journalists take became a bit too much for me. I hate trump as much as the next, but hearing the reporters scoff and snicker when telling the news became overly opinionated for me. I don't want to have to filter from NPR just like I would from Fox, and after 3 months of listening I felt like it got to that point. Bummed me out...especially because I agree politically. I don't appreciate being told how to think from a journalist. I'd rather receive the news and make up my mind from there. ",2
"Quick, varied and reliable.",08/26/2017,jbnath314,"I'm a medical student and listen to up first every morning on my way to the hospital.

An Abbreviated Morning Edition,08/19/2017,lmacray,"I really enjoy Up First! I agree with the other reviews that note it doesn't do any deep dives into news like NYT's The Daily, but I think it does a good job highlighting top headlines, not just domestically, but internationally as well.",4

Thank you again NPR!",5
Trump every morning,08/23/2017,Tom Hendricks,There has to be something more important to report every morning than Trump. 90% of up first reporting is on the current unpopular president.

All I want in the morning,08/23/2017,Tinyqueenie,"Frankly, the news is beyond depressing if you get stuck reading article after article.

Huge fan,08/18/2017,AppA44ict,"Up First has quickly become an integral part of my morning routine.

Great!,08/18/2017,maddiejohnson5493,"This is a great podcast that provides a general snapshot of the day's news!

Great Tidbit on the day,08/14/2017,Scott T Mac,I don't have a long commute any longer and I miss my time with NPR. UF gives me a quick hit of news and interesting storylines for the short time I'm on the road throughout the day. Thoroughly enjoy it.,5

A little news in the morning,08/17/2017,Jgdssdq,I enjoy listening to a little news in the morning. It gives just enough to tell the story without feeling like you are missing out on key facts. But also enough that if you want you can look up the stories with key words. They also go into both sides of the situation which is nice when you don't really want to deal with too much bias. They stick to the news. I see complaints about beyonce and stuff but I have been listening for the last month and I haven't heard any pop news whenever i listen which is frequently.,4

Addiction to opioids or Trump?,08/11/2017,secret thoughts secret motives,"I've listened to this podcast in hopes that I'd receive news that truly is important or relevant, but instead, I get all days minus one where Trump is landblasted.

I'm unsubscribing, because I can get this exact news elsewhere.",1
Great distillation of the most important daily news,08/11/2017,rmgallagher,"This podcast succinctly and concisely presents the daily headlines and news stories. I think it greatly complements The Daily since Up First gives a broader and scattershot view of recent events. The Daily typically focuses on one story and then gives a brief summary of the rest of the news. Up First gives a more in-depth summary and in a somehow more concise manner. I listen to Up First every morning. Further, I believe their reporting rests somewhere in or near the center of the ideological and political spectrum, which is refreshing in today's polarized climate.",5
Great show but...,08/11/2017,Jessiebear827,"Since this is a radio show I'm sure standards for radio voices are pretty high.

A decent daily dose of news,08/08/2017,ARothmanMusic,"This show is well-done, which you'd expect of an NPR product.

Not like The Daily,08/08/2017,Marisam819,"I listen to both Up First and The Daily everyday and the format is different. I like that Up First provides an overview of major news stories for that day. If you want to know more about a story, you can listen to their radio station, another podcast (such as NPR Politics) or read an article. The Daily seems to spend more time going into a specific story, not necessarily what is top news for the day.

I can listen for just a few minutes in the morning and be sure I have been updated on the most important news stories. The only reason I don't give it five starts is certain stories make me wonder if that was really among the most important news stories, like Jay-Z's album release. But recently I haven't heard as many stories like that. This is one of my go to podcasts and the way I always start my work day.",4
Couldn't listen every day.,08/08/2017,dequace,"Not bad. News summary, some sound effects, a little music. Tends to focus around bashing Trump, which is fine for a bit, but gets old quick. Just give me the news. Listened daily for a month or two, and finally found they had little new to say each day, despite the current events.",3

Effective but Biased,08/09/2017,THenley32334,I truly appreciate the direct approach to the daily news. But it is a shame the slant is so strongly to the left. An honest presentation of the facts would be much more desirable!,3

I don't like the news,08/01/2017,Superwomanunderwear,"I haven't watched or listened to the news since 2007, but this podcast has enabled me to know what's going on in the world without having to get too involved. It's a great snapshot of the day's news without going too talking head or getting too depressing. It's the first thing I listen to on weekday mornings.",5
Great start to the day!,08/02/2017,wensalome,"This quick 10-12 minute podcast is always the first thing I listen to in the morning. It's short, it hits on the most important stories that are coming for the day, and it has some of my favorite NPR voices.",5
Can Bob Stop Interrupting?,08/02/2017,Dinged121313,Would be the perfect podcast if not for one of the journalists just constantly interrupting both guests and other hosts each time-- grew to be unbearable to listen to.,2
A relief,08/02/2017,Kaanbuli,I'm so glad to get a synopsis of the headlines without having spend the additional time reading it. Especially because the news is most often discouraging. I can stay current without having to immerse myself in the negative words. Thanks.,5
Lovely I say,08/02/2017,Benny the Blade,"I appreciate this take on the daily news format. It is my go to start of every week day, and I am a better informed citizen because of it.",5
Concise and comprehensive,08/02/2017,EveBethel,"I listen to Up First every morning on my walk to work. It gives me a great summary if the top news stories to keep my eye on during the day and the upcoming week.

Great for Bite Size News,08/03/2017,jmn1989,"Lots of people have been comparing this to The Daily, but personally, I feel this podcast has something different to offer.

Excellent ! Love it,08/03/2017,HeatherRae237,I start my morning every weekday with you!,5
Swing and a miss,08/03/2017,getrealpeople!,"I wish that a program, not to mention an entire organizaton, heavily funded by tax payer dollars, would be more reflective of the country in general. I have listened and watched NPR for most of my life. Sadly it has become a left wing sounding board which leaves out any opportunity for rational discussions which explore the whole story.",1
Perfect Morning Podcast,08/04/2017,Swampfox4,"I love catching up on the current news while commuting to work. They give you the ""meat"" of the news in 12 minutes so you can get on with your life.",5

This podcast is a MUST!,08/05/2017,RallyX99,"Want to keep up with the big issues of the day? Do you have 12-14 minutes for a podcast? Perfect! Much, much more than simply a news preview, Up First covers all the big stuff you need to know.",5
Great for the busy listener,08/06/2017,Junomrl2016,I hardly ever miss an episode. I love waking up to a great synopsis of the day's news with my favorite radio personalities.,5
This is OK,08/06/2017,Kbev95,"It is what it is. 10 mins of stories and a little bit of discussion. It's a good mix of the two. It's not purely news, but that's ok",4
Great morning podcast,08/07/2017,emilyem890,It's a short podcast that I always start my day with. It's informative and gives all the big stories for the day. I would definitely recommend listening to it,5

"Good, Morning Podcast",08/08/2017,Dumb Window,Great morning podcast with essential news. Does a good job of getting to the point and covering a good variety of national and international news.,1
"Dissapointing, stick to what NPR does best",07/28/2017,Fonteszdr,"The concept of a condesed morning news pod from one of the best sources around had appeal. But this is like people got in a conference room and tried to figure out how to ""lighten the mood"" or ""appeal to a younger audience"" or ""engage with the zeitgeist.""",2
Good Way to Start Day üëçüèæ,07/28/2017,illphil500,This short podcast helps keep me informed in what is going on without dragging on too long. I think the transitions are effective in giving brief overviews on each topic.,5
All you need to know in 15 minutes,07/28/2017,Slumrunner,"Up first is great, it's the first thing I listen to during my morning commute. The only down side to listening to Up First every morning, is that it really showed me how speculative the NPR politics podcast is. They really don't give you anything new news; all they do is speculate on what that news could mean and than push their political biases on to the subject.To conclude, Up First is so concise and to the point that the reporters political biases are much harder to hide in the reporting of the stories.",5
Yemen,07/28/2017,TaylorJaymes,Please start covering the starvation happening in Yemen and South Sudan,3
Best source for daily news,07/28/2017,aranteach,This podcast gives just the right amount of information to let you know what the big things to watch for that day are. Essential listening for me.,5

Great snapshot,07/29/2017,PrincessNita,"I start each morning with this show and the Daily. I love how they hit on US, World, and pop culture.",5
Like a daily cup of coffee,07/29/2017,Kristaleighbird,This podcast is a great companion to my medium blend morning cup of coffee. Not overwhelming 1st thing in the morning but not overly vague either. It's a casual 10-15 minute summary/discussion of all topics I might want to bring my attention to. It's like a morning chat with people in the know. Then listen to NPR Politics Thursday roundup for more in depth discussion of all the topics of the week!,5
One sided reporting,07/30/2017,appreciative listner,"Love the format, it is concise and explanatory, and ready to listen to every morning when I wake up. However, the political issues are constantly addressed from one perspective and often leave me feeling like I'm missing a large part of the story. Appreciate podcast but just wish there was a more inclusive perspective. :/",3
Love it!,07/30/2017,Fifi_FL,"Thank you so much for doing this podcast! I listen to real news in 12 min or so every day. I'm a person that struggles with the news but wants to stay informed. This podcast is perfect for me. On track, true and perfect duration! I hope you keep doing it",5
More to Love than Loathe,07/30/2017,Gaaarp,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when this podcast first aired, but what I got was a decent roundup of the day's top stories with a bit too much commercial content for my liking.",4
Quick daily preview/summary,07/30/2017,Doof man,"I listen to this every morning, right before I listen to the more in-depth (NYT) The Daily. The two podcasts complement each other well, esp when The Daily's topic is more involved than I am interested in or have time for.",5
The podcast I listen to over coffee,07/31/2017,Emmar11623,"Love the short take. Pretty focused on US news, but still one of my favorite podcasts.",5

Exactly what it promises,07/31/2017,Astarrh,It's a news round-up. I really enjoy listening to this podcast while I make breakfast. Just a brief update without too much time spent on analysis. It gets right to the point.,5
Great start to my weekday!,07/31/2017,TPWNYC,This and the NYT's The Daily are all u need to leave your home informed.,5
Perfect for me,08/01/2017,Nikki8126,"This podcast is perfect for me, someone who wants to be up to date with current news but doesn't want to listen for hours. The main headlines are presented in a concise way and the hosts have personality so it doesn't feel dry. I enjoy listening every morning.",4
Great Morning Listen,08/01/2017,TRG19,"Informative, compact, and entertaining. The music is great. Comparisons to NYT's The Daily are irrelevant. This show is great for an overview of the news. Further reading is on the listener. Love the music as well.",5
Worth a listen,08/01/2017,Grumpy CT,"A decent quick summary of the daily news (mostly political). Something simple I wish they'd do is to start the podcast with the date (i.e. ""This is our podcast for January 9th""). I usually listen while the phone is in my pocket, and it's tough to tell if I'm listening to the current episode or an older one in my library.",4
Quick and Entertaining,08/01/2017,Motoridernj,I find it covers more topics but with fewer details than the Daily. It's a fun pace that takes itself less seriously while still providing serous news. I combine it with the Daily on my morning commute and find it an effective tag team.,4
Perfect,07/24/2017,Dianora,To the point and informative. Great way to start out my day.,5
First stop each day,07/25/2017,Kagerber1980,"First thing I listen to every day. Love it. Informative, concise and thoughtful.",5
Too much commentary,07/25/2017,JustListenPlease,The content and reporting is strong but the little side comments and jokes are annoying and compromise the tone.,4
Worst theme music ever,07/25/2017,MaeFreds,"Long ads, boring stories, horrible theme music. Listened for a week and had to unsubscribe.",2
Perfect every morning,07/25/2017,FreedomBeale,Great way to the headline news every morning. Glad they include international stories every day too!,5
Great listen for a busy morning,07/26/2017,JennaTJenna,"It's well-produced, quick & informative to prepare you for the day and keep you up to date.",5
Slanted,07/26/2017,KToo...,Nice morning recap of news but minimal in the amount of stories covered (usually 3 topics). Slanted news anchors make me question equal coverage of issues. I do like the guest reporters & their first hand accounts.,3
Excellent podcast,07/26/2017,debllstl,I listen every morning & learn interesting news details. Excellent podcast. Thank you NPR!,5
What I want first thing,07/27/2017,Laur4792,"I wish it included a bit more diversity than being majority politics. Other stuff is happening in the world that I'd like to hear about too. I'm glad the pop culture stuff that was included in many of the initial episodes has been much less frequent. I'm of the opinion that celebrities are generally not newsworthy (and I'm not an old curmudgeon, a xennial).",5
Great way to keep up,07/27/2017,Fecramsey,"I'm addicted to my Up First podcast! I needed a new way of staying up to date on all things news. It's quick, nicely done and makes complex works news easy to understand.",5
My Favorite Way to Start the Day,07/27/2017,Clinnnnnnt,"Unlike other daily news podcasts, this one doesn't seem like it was pre-planned and pre-recorded the previous day. (I'm referring specifically to The Daily, which I like, but it's not ""news."") The Up First hosts actually report on what happened while the rest of the country was sleeping. Speaking of the hosts, they're knowledgeable as well as personable. In approximately 12 minutes each morning, I'm caught up on the major stories that are of interest to me. Great job, NPR.",5
Great morning headlines,07/27/2017,Laroc729,"Really enjoy being caught up with top headlines on the way to work. Easily understandable and quick. Only this that is disappointing is some ""top"" important headlines are not top importance to people who want NPR to educate them. Beyonc√© really??",4
Almost as good as NYT's The Daily,07/27/2017,JakeStarlite,"I listen every day and find most podcasts informative but I still prefer ""The Daily"".",5
Listener,07/27/2017,Jessica 517,"I got in the car this morning and started to put on some music and my 11-year-old said, ""Aren't we going to listen to Up First? We should start with that."" Thanks for helping me to raise an engaged and aware citizen!",5
Best for busy schedules,07/27/2017,She-ra is awesome,"I have several jobs and am always on the go. This is the best, most concise news I get each day. Love the hosts!",5
Bare bones news updates,07/27/2017,2015xt,"10mins of packed information that skins the surface. Good to know what's happening in the world, but not enough time to understand WHY things are happening.",5

Just the Right Amount,07/20/2017,TayKens,I really enjoy this podcast. The hosts are all great and it's on my list of podcasts I listen to every morning while getting ready for work. I also like The Daily but it's a different format from this podcast. I listen to them both.,5
The News Digest I Didn't Know I Needed,07/20/2017,k8.mcgowan,"Perfect length for listening to while I make coffee in the morning. Available early, so no matter when I need to be somewhere I can feel informed.",5

Worth listening,07/20/2017,JL718,I really enjoy this podcast every morning while I get ready. I have to agree that there are some misses occasionally-the Beyonce stuff didn't interest me either.,4
Love this Program,07/20/2017,Patty pop,This podcast is my morning shot in the arm. I just love it! David Greens voice is so comforting and smooooooth.,5
Great Review to catch up on news,07/20/2017,JaqNotJill,I listen to this on my way to work everyday. I like the continuity of it and the coverage. If I hear something I want to know more about I can then go look it up. Thanks!,5
Best morning news blast,07/20/2017,Michey's iPhone,I listen to Up First on my walk to work each day. It's the perfect way to stay informed on the major news stories. Keep up the good work!,5
"Great balance, perfect dose",07/21/2017,Superjuliebelle,I'm very pleased to have this balance of news coverage appear first in my podcast queue every weekday. It presents NPR coverage I trust in a wonderfully short format. I couldn't do without it at the start of my day.,5
Essential listening,07/21/2017,oswharton,NPR is killing it under Drumpf,5
Good overview,07/21/2017,Mynameisnicknametaken573985,"Good overview, but I think it's a little too light on details. I'm almost always surprised at how short this show is. I don't think listeners would mind if you took this to a 20 minute show and went a little deeper.",4
Great for an early morning commute,07/21/2017,ScamBoss,"A great way to stay on top of the news, especially if you commute early. It fits in easily to the car ride and keeps me passably up to date, even when I'm buried in a cubicle for most of the day.",5
Perfect for your morning commute.,07/21/2017,Klmcdnald,I walk to work and listen to Up First and The Daily every morning for my morning news. I find that both podcasts bring different news and stories and they rarely overlap. I honestly wish there was a longer version that I could listen to once I got to work. Great podcast!,5
Great way to keep a pulse on world events.,07/23/2017,Newtwitteruser,Concise accurate coverage.,5
At least it's only 9 minutes long.,07/24/2017,NEW1969,"From the they-are-trying-too-hard-to-be-like-NYT's-The Daily-minor key bumper music to Steve Inskeep interrupting everyone, everything about this is annoying. It emphasizes why I quit NPR almost a year ago, which is, the reporting lacks substance. I get this is supposed to be brief, and sometimes it succeeds in giving you 1-3 top headlines. I still recall the day, however, Jay Z's new album came out and that made the headlines, proving once again, NPR is guilty of providing saccharine headlines to keep Americans warm and sedated. It's a waste of 10 minutes. Stick with PBS news hour. It's actually good journalism for an entire hour.",1
"Quick, informative.",07/24/2017,adreibs,Love having this podcast as a part of my day. Makes getting ready more interesting and I never feel like I'm missing out on the news like I used to.,5

This is how you should start your day!,07/24/2017,Editorgirlchicago,Listening to this podcast will give you that quick dose of today's news that you need to start your day!,5
Enjoyable morning run down,07/24/2017,Aeasoprano,A great podcast to listen to with your morning coffee or while you brush your teeth. Gives a general breakdown of the days events. Mostly it's a quick overview- just enough content to distill what matters that day without sifting through the weeds. It's differs from NYT's the Daily as it is less in depth. I listen to both since the content doesn't usually overlap and it takes less than 30mins.,5
Great daily summary!,07/24/2017,ItaboRosa8,This is a great way to give a brief summary of daily highlights. I appreciate all the effort that goes into producing each segment - thank you!,5

Great start to my morning,07/18/2017,AnnArborK,"This 12-14 minute weekday-ly podcast brings me up to date on what's happened overnight and yesterday, and sets me up to understand the important items coming today. I like the informal tone mixed with heavy substance. The first podcast I listen to on my commute to work.",5
Helpful,07/18/2017,Olivehead123,"I was going to give this podcast four stars, but then I saw all the reviewers saying this isn't the Daily. Duh! If they wanted to recreate the Daily, NPR, would. It's a different approach to a very similar project. I listen to both every day, because I find them both uniquely helpful in sussing out the noise of the day. It may not go as deeply into each topic, but I find it casts a wider net, for better and for worse. If you're looking for a quick way to understand at all what's going on in this country, and occasionally the world, this is a great thing to play while brushing your teeth and packing your lunch.",5
Great Stuff,07/18/2017,phototraveler,"Your pod cast is one of the two daily news pod cast I always get!!!!

Thank you!!!",5
"Brush Teeth, Shower, Listen to Up First",07/18/2017,Brian Reiser,"Listening to NPR's Up First is part of my morning routine every single day now. I love the essential recap of what is going on right now in the world and what to be ready for in the coming day. I feel like I'm in the loop and I get all of the scoop in a nice, manageable ten-minute bite size chunk. Quick time investment, big payoff. If you're an NPR fan or just looking for a way to get up to speed on the current news that will be shaping the day, this is the Podcast for you.",5

Quick & Insightful Highlight,07/19/2017,Candace42,This podcast provides an overview of the day's headlines with insightful analysis to help place the info in context.,5
"Useful, quick, & informative",07/20/2017,j-ha2,The only problem with this short daily podcast is that i typically hear the identical stories on the drive to work 15 minutes after I hear the podcast. It would be nice to get a little more or varied info in the podcast. Most useful to me on my days off.,3
#1 for News,07/20/2017,Lindfhudsyb,Such a great time passer on the way to work. It gets to the point and is fresh daily.,5

First thing I listen to in the morning,07/20/2017,Kcampbell824,"I used to wake up to the NPR newscast in the morning, but this is so much better with a bit more depth. Just the right amount as I'm preparing coffee and so I at least have a general idea of what is going on in the world before heading to work.",5
Perfect to start my day,07/20/2017,Liddyiowa,I like to listen to podcasts on my to and from work so I often miss the NPR morning shows on the air. Which means I feel clueless about the day's headlines. Up First is the solution to my problem and I love it. I especially like how there's a lighthearted attitude and the show doesn't take itself too seriously while still delivering the high quality journalism I expect from NPR. I highly recommend it!,5

Calm down Steve,07/12/2017,357830444,Steve please quit interrupting Rachel while she's talking.,4
Good way to begin the day.,07/12/2017,cdrez,I enjoy the brief introduction to top stories of the day. I have to say that I have enjoyed most of the stories. I am getting tired of hearing about Trump supporters and where they stand against the Trump controversies. I don't think it is news that they are continuing to turn a blind eye to everything that all that is wrong with the Trump administration. I want to hear more from other Americans who have a more broader perspective of what is really going on.,3
I love it.,07/13/2017,Goshidk,I love listening to this on my commute. That main guy is super annoying. It seems you could tell his position on everything from his tone to framing.,5
Not the Daily -- in a good way,07/13/2017,@dabrighenti,"I see lots of reviews comparing it to the Daily.I go to Up First for top headlines, whereas the Daily often picks a big story that doesn't necessarily have a news peg to focus on. Both are great but each is doing its own thing -- which I love!",5
decent overview,07/14/2017,Shanster1966,"I enjoy the content, but the intro music has to be changed. There's a heavy beat every second for the first minute. It's distracting, bordering on painful. Please lighten it up.",4
10 minutes of relevant plus interesting,07/14/2017,Elisa.elisa,"Enough fun to keep my coming back, a lot of great info for when I don't want to scroll through my phone and rather listen.",5

Short and Sweet,07/14/2017,KatLank,"Provides a great overview of the day's news. I listen to it daily, then follow up with other sources to fill out the details. If you're looking for a fairly quick rundown of top news stories (usually runs 11-15 minutes), this is the podcast for you.",5
NPR is my go-to for real news,07/15/2017,Ed.is.right!,"Thanks, NPR. Quick, to-the-point, and informative.",5
Usually great,07/16/2017,jemcgimpsey,"At its best when it tightly focuses on the two or three most important issues that will be making news that day, giving context to the stories I'll see later.

Wake up in the know,07/18/2017,JillianSed,"I work in news (not at NPR) and this podcast is the first thing I listen to each morning to catch up on the biggest stories I need to know that day even before reading my own site. It's informative, succinct and thoughtful.",5
Short and sweet,07/06/2017,AverageJoey111,"Gets you the info that's important. Not super in depth, but that's the point. Just give you an overview of what you need to know from the day before. Covers a broad range of topics, but is usually following politics. Also the hosts are great, as always!",5
Perfect brief podcast,07/06/2017,Mspaigess,This is what I listen to first every morning. It's a short podcast that lets me know what I want to know more about that I missed in the last 24 hours and what might be coming up that day. It's not super in depth. It's just enough to keep me informed so I don't get lost in how crazy things have been as of late.,5
Good news summary,07/07/2017,R Liam,Good summary of overall news. This plus BBC Business Daily is my recommended combination in the AM,5
"Better Reporting, but not without flaws",07/07/2017,Mafleeted,"Reporting is much better than The Daily, which often shows its bias. Not without its own flaws, however - sarcastic comments about China's communism with respect to golf comes to mind.",4
Needs some upgrades to be tolerable,07/07/2017,Outdoor Adventurist,"Upgrade #1 - The music! It's incredibly annoying and plays a lot, considering the podcast is only 10 minutes.",2
Meh,07/07/2017,JerryMN,This show is an ok recap but ends up being too much of the hosts talking or giving opinions and not enough relevant news.,2

Prattle First,07/09/2017,El Nigito,"While this is a good length for a morning ""news hits"" pod, the ""news"" they fill it with is garbage. First, they waste time with celebrity tabloid fare. Second, they provide nothing more substantive than I would get just scrolling a news site's front page. Additionally, the hosts leave much to be desired, and remind me why I stopped listening to Morning Edition.",2
News in podcast,07/10/2017,Jackie462,I am so grateful that NPR came up with a way for me to hear my favorite newscasters on a podcast since I don't really listen to the radio anymore.,5

Perfect,07/10/2017,BenDuffie,"This is a short 12-15 minute bite-sized chunk of news from NPR. Perfect for a morning commute or while you are getting ready in the morning. Great hosts, great variety of coverage from different topics. This is how I start my day, everyday. If you are complaining it isn't enough, simply turn on your NPR station. This is meant to wet your appetite for more news of the day.",5

"Solid idea, updated review",07/10/2017,AHWolf,"I like the idea of this a lot and pairing it up with NYT's Daily is perfect for my commute. However, the third headline is fluff and unwelcome when the tag is ""the most important headlines of the day."" I get wanting to end on a positive note, but doing so with Beyonc√© anniversaries and a new NYC restaurant while putting it on the same level of importance as chemical attacks in Syria or the upcoming meeting with China's president makes me wince. Keep trying.",5
What we need is more liberal news,07/11/2017,Maddening,"Have been listening for over 2 months just to give podcast a chance. More emphasis on beating Trump into the ground than anything else. It is basically the same information you would hear by watching any of the mainstream media, or reading the New York Times. Just another news broadcast with a left wing spin on everything. Very disappointing, I am unsubscribing today.",1
Great way to start my morning!,06/30/2017,SplendidSmiles,UpFirst is perfect for my morning routine (shower + dress) and gets me started off right!,5
The news,06/30/2017,Can I have my dollar back?,"Imagine the daily, but done in half the time. Up first also tends to cover more topics. The daily covers 1-2 topics in 20 minutes (then typically has a 1-3 minute round up that just tell you 2-3 things that happened).",5
Jay-Z and Beyonc√©? Really?,06/30/2017,Childfreesista,I thought this podcast was going to cover the most important news of the day. I didn't subscribe to hear about Jay Z and Beyonce. A celebrity couple is not news. It's gossip. Unsubscribing.,1
Watch out for stereotypes,06/30/2017,Onomi Bachan,"I started listening to Up First two days ago. The format and content serve well it's purpose as ""quick morning updates."" However, when listening to today's episode (Friday, June 30th), I found the part about the anniversary of the hand-over biased, and even kinda irresponsible for reinforcing the stereotype about China. Given the short timeframe, of course I am not asking for a research or anything, but it is not hard to just include more than one voice, probably takes 1 minute I guess. As for the comment ""red is a communist color,"" it is just completely unnecessary to add that. NPR, as such an influential medium, should take the responsibility to fight against these oversimplified and unjust stereotypes.",3

PERFECT,06/30/2017,Mjoy321,absolutley perfect thing keep me just a little bit in the know as I get going for the day. Otherwise I don't listen to the news until the night or maybe even the weekend. Life is busy and this is great. Thank you.,5
Stay focused please,06/30/2017,AdotTAYLOR,I'm a fan and listen daily but I really get annoyed when they don't focus on actual NEWS. I love JayZ as much as the rest of the world...yes I listened to 4:44 today...but why is this a topic of discussion in a 10 minute news show that is supposed to be designed to keep me informed about today's important issuesü§î?!

Completely Biased,07/05/2017,Slap its,"I love NPR, and wanted a quick news output to listen to in the morning. Instead I got an ""I Hate Trump"" podcast.

I hate watching the news. This is an awesome way to stay in the loop!,07/05/2017,veggiemegg,"A great way to start the day! A nice little summary of recent stories and events. Don't know why people are leaving negative reviews, complaining about things like the discussion of Beyonc√©/Jay-Z. It's in the description- ""from politics to pop culture""...from what I understand, music and celebrity topics fall under pop culture. If you want strictly politics, there are plentyyyyy of political podcasts. This one is a great blend of everything! Perfect in the morning while you get ready for the day.",5
This is What We Need,07/05/2017,Hank0928,"I see a lot of comparisons to The Daily, which I also listen to each day. However, I don't see the need to pick one over the other; they're both great and I need all the news briefings I can get these days!",4
Best summary of the day's events,07/05/2017,pamela isley,"Up First covers all the major events of the day and gives me a working knowledge of the major issues at hand. Less in depth than the Daily, but more up to date. Sorry some people think human interest pieces are worthless.",5

A bit of news,06/26/2017,nanseajo,"I like NPR's Up First because it offers me a bit of national news without having to hear about the same story over and over again. I like the short reporting style and the simple language used, as some of the political and economic stories can be loaded with jargon on the TV news, and the podcast does a great job of simplifying the language. It doesn't replace my news, but it does a nice job of supplementing it.",5

Not Great,06/21/2017,Meganalexah,Lackluster. Just barely scratches the surface every day. This podcast is more like a long format ad for the NPR app. NYT The Daily is so much better.,1
Disappointing,06/21/2017,Nattytiii,This podcast is nearly 20% ads: a full minute at the start and 2-3 at the close. This isn't so much a quick synopsis of the news as a dumbed down version. Perfect for those with short attention spans but frustrating for anyone looking for unique insight. The NYT's The Daily is far superior.,3
Great!,06/21/2017,Tytttytttgfdfh,I love this podcast. I listen to it daily on my way to work. I just wish it was longer so it could cover more stories.,5

Informative,06/17/2017,Sew4me,This is the first podcast I listen to each morning. Bite size is just enough to know what's happening without having to listen long. I like the diverseness of this podcast including Beyonc√© I just like getting all aspects of what's happening in the world.,5
Great,06/18/2017,Matt8800,"Much better than listening to NPR via the radio. This podcast is just what I want - the news, annotated, briefly. At this point, I've stopped listening to my local NPR station (WAMU in Washington). WAMU has oddly stopped carrying useful local news (like traffic) and instead blathers on with Garrison Keillor reading poetry, long winded discussions via StoryCorp, or lengthy discussions on streetcars in DC.

Perfect to begin the day,06/19/2017,MLSYogi,I've stopped listening to the regular broadcasts as I can't take it anymore. This daily podcast tells me what I need to know with very little commentary. I appreciate that. I am now devoted listener. Thank you NPR,5

"Decent, more overt bias than the radio",06/20/2017,StephenHarperHair,"I listened to this podcast from its very beginning, motivated mainly by the fact that my car radio broke and I needed something to listen to on my way to work. I found it to be a decent substitute for Morning Edition, but I stopped listening once I fixed my radio.",4
"Entertaining, insightful but too focused on the us",06/20/2017,Kjo22,"I love morning edition and the hosts. The coverage in the show is fantastic and although I get that this is a quick summary of the daily news, I think there could be a bit more on international news.

Love and rely on Up First!,06/20/2017,Normee77,Up First is not only my must listen every morning but gives me just the right headlines to stay up to date on national political news since my work often doesn't allow me to watch or listen to the news consistently.

Exactly what I was looking for.....,06/14/2017,knittingdeb,"Up first is exactly what I was looking for to keep me updated on political events in recent months.

Regular NPR listener baffled by Up First's poor quality,06/15/2017,clausfawn,"This show is terrible. From the jaunty tone of the hosts to the theme music, it is so inappropriately at odds with the material that it feels deranged. A show fully complicit with the urgently corrupt politics of the moment, cowered to accusations that left-leaning journalists have to be ""balanced""- by being shallow idiots, evidently.",1
Biased,06/15/2017,GoochMiller,Incredibly biased. Poor journalism. I am only rating it one star because I'm not granted to rate it any lower. Just to be clear I have listened to every episode since their launch- and I have become more and more disappointed as the days go on. Steve is garbage.,1
Slightly too partisan for my liking,06/15/2017,BrianPhys,"I find that many NPR programs are tilted too much to the left and this morning news summary program follows the pattern. The tilt affects their editorializing of events, selection of experts, and selection of news stories to detail. In the current political scene it is difficult to remain neutral or give equal coverage to both sides of a story but this program could do a much better job of providing a more even coverage of the news.",2
Great headline summary,06/15/2017,Lila310,"Excellent pairing with The Daily (NYT)-- more breadth than depth but still captures the news at the start of the day. Plus, the NPR correspondents are excellent.",5

Shocking reporting or lack of,06/16/2017,StanSien,Can't believe a podcast that says it will give you the morning news waited until the last 3 minutes of an 11 minute podcast to discuss the shooting of an American congressman.

"It's NPR, in a single serving",06/16/2017,Don't like writing reviews,"They try to cover everything, some days great, others a little something else which doesn't always work.

A Day Late,06/08/2017,Goofy the Dwarf,They should rename this podcast a Day Late. It is raely available in iTunes for download on the day it is supposed to be released.

The podcast I didn't realize I needed,06/08/2017,jklued,"I really enjoy Up First and listen to it in the shower/bathroom while I get ready for work in the morning. So much so that I write this review in attempt to get aaaaaaalllll the other NOR podcast hosts to stop telling me to check it out. Please, everyone who lives NPR, just listen to this and be happy with your additional option of getting your news each day. Enjoy!",4
Quick update of the important news,06/09/2017,Middle River Terp,Just the podcast you need to catch up on the news and know what will the big news for the day.,5
Great rundown,06/09/2017,MichelleR1161,Perfect to download in the morning while getting ready and play on my commute. Important and informing during these challenging times.,5
Please change the background music,06/09/2017,iWabiSabi,"I love the podcast but the repetitive bumper music is irritating - especially the synthesized strings ""doo... doo... doo...""",3
Bias,06/09/2017,2144main,The news is too biased and slanted. Not objective at all. It's good to listen to if you want the far left's slant on the news.,1
Succinct,06/10/2017,Saifine56,Insightful and simple enough for a politics na√Øve like me,5
Great way to start the day,06/10/2017,spbennie,Very well done and a great snap shot for the morning.,5
Amazing,06/10/2017,Abvinyimjim,This podcast allows people to have a sense of understanding of the top stories domestically and internationally. The hosts as well as guests are also spectacular and have a grounded idea of what their talking about.,5
Liking it,06/10/2017,Abhi321,I am a big fan of the The Daily podcast of NY Times. But I like this too. I listen to both daily. It does not go into deep like the The Daily but it summarizes all the news for me which i like.,4
Needs pep but like the experiment,06/11/2017,Darveesh,Perhaps its the jingle. But the ding dong opener is just depressing. Suggest something more uplifting for daily morning show. I get the casual / talkative format. Its different and am willing to give it time to like.,3
I start every morning commute with this podcast!,06/11/2017,nomusclerussell,"Love, Love, Love this! Keep it up! I download and tune in every morning!",5
Perfect!,06/11/2017,intparent,"My only problem is that I miss you on the weekends. :( And much better than the new NYT daily podcast -- tighter, pithier. You guys own podcast and radio compared to them. :)",5
You don't like Trump...we get it!!!,06/12/2017,iUsedtoBeSomebody,Pretty standard NPR. I just can't believe the only thing happening in the world is Donald Trump tweeting something...guess there must be no other news to report. Wish it was more than just Washington politics.,2
Nice morning recap,06/12/2017,Funny & Addicting,Up First is a helpful snippet of what's coming up in the news as well as what happened after I stopped paying attention the day before. It's a nice complement to Morning Edition.,5
Informative and short and interesting!,06/12/2017,Dichen678,"Just what like every morning. I've been wanting to follow a daily news podcast, and this one if perfect because it's short and I can actually listen to it first thing after waking up and finish it while I'm getting ready and before I'm out the door!",5
Awesome for busy people,06/12/2017,Muslim vvvvvvv vvvvvvv vv,"Awesome podcast for busy people.
I listen at 2X speed & updated on all the important news in a few minutes.",5
A must listen for me every morning.,06/05/2017,aaron delaware,A great companion to the Daily.,5
One of the best,06/05/2017,VTgreenboy,A fantastic review and preview of the most recent and important events.,5
Everyday,06/06/2017,Terese625,I listen everyday. When we we traveling last month it was nice to get the basics of the day's news in 10 mins or so.,5
Perfect for the morning!,06/06/2017,Sonja TB,"When I wake up in the morning and I want to get caught up on the news, I listen to this and 5 minutes later I'm caught up. It's good if you want a quick catch up on the news. I love NPR!",5
"Political opinion, not news.",06/06/2017,SwillGo,"Unbalanced reporting at it's finest. NPR used to be a bastion of fair and honest journalism, but no longer. If you're looking for the liberal version of Breitbart, you've found your echo chamber.",1
You're getting too liberal,06/06/2017,Gjgdjkd,One of the main reasons i liked you guys was because you kept it somewhere in the middle obviously leaning a little more left (you are a somewhat mainstream media outlet) but now you're getting too far on the left just report the news that's all I want i can form my own opinions.,1
Great overview of the big stories!,06/06/2017,btbond007,This pod provides a great short overview of each days big stories. It's how I start my day now!,5
Excellent morning podcast,06/06/2017,**Carm**,"This is exactly the right style, content, and length for a news podcast to listen to in the morning. 12-15 minutes is very manageable to listen to regularly, so I've listened to every episode as they've come out, unlike the Daily, which I often miss because it's too long of a time commitment some day and drags on too much. It took them a few weeks to figure out the content and tone (the attempts at ""relevant"" pop culture content as a third of the program early missed the mark a bit), but I think by now they've really hit their stride, and it's a thoroughly enjoyable and informative podcast. Obviously, you don't get the same breadth and detail as on Morning Edition, but if I'm not commuting in a car I'm probably not going to listen to all of Morning Edition anyways, so this is a great compromise.",5
Great news podcast,06/06/2017,Small Thing,I just wish it were longer! I want more Up First.,5
Love it!,06/06/2017,biscuitable,I love this podcast--it's exactly long enough for my morning commute. I only wish there was a corresponding afternoon version for my drive home again!,5
Excellent News Nugget,06/07/2017,IBRUTHA,First listen on the way to work,5
Lovely start to the morning,06/07/2017,Sir Custard,"Up first doesn't dive deep into its daily topics, but it doesn't claim or intend to either. It's a great briefing on the day's news - I love listening to it while I make my coffee. It's short, sweet, and simple. The theme music is also awesome!",5
Great.,06/07/2017,MafeLoreto,"Best way to wake up - solid discussions and all in ten minutes. They pick three topics to discuss every morning and it feels very casual and conversational, which helps with the somber and heavy news we get these days. Unlike other reviewers, I do like the fact that sometimes one of the daily discussion topics is something light like a new album or movie. All news don't need to be terrible in order to be important.",5
#1POD,06/07/2017,Marts8150,Up First truly is the podcast I listen to first thing in the morning. It provides enough and significant news to keep me current.,5
Quick and Smart,06/07/2017,dickthompson,"This is a great quick way to start the morning. Love that it is fast, smart, and well reported.",5
Get new music,06/07/2017,Douglas in Atlanta,"I like the content, though it goes a bit long. But the music used gets completely on my last nerve. It's like some Bizarro World version of the NBC chime. Honestly, it puts my teeth on edge and darkens my mood considerably. I won't be listening anymore.",3
Somewhat informative,06/08/2017,aStarvingSinger,"I've been listening for over a month now. It feels like the podcast was moving in the direction of a typical tv morning show, hopefully it swings back to being more of a news brief. Some of the NPR reporter interviews are still great.",3
Great summary,06/08/2017,Stella digs,"Listen every day while making coffee, perfect short intro to the news of the day.",5
Efficient and Important News,06/08/2017,beachboy23,"With a 5 minute commute to work, and a very busy morning schedule as an elementary teacher, I can rarely find the time to listen to the news. Up Next expertly highlights the key news stories of the day in 10-15 minutes, giving me the opportunity to stay engaged with current events. As always for NPR, excellent reporting and producing make for a wonderful show which I have highly recommended to my friends.",5
Best way to start the day,06/08/2017,Luco brazzi,"This podcast and the daily are how start my day on my commute each morning. I like the personalities on up first more than Michael Barbaro on the daily, who sometimes seems like he asks very leading questions to his interviewees.",5
Perfect update for my fast moving morning,06/01/2017,PinkPoppy9845,I listen every morning as a supplement to my regular NPR listening.,5
Has become indespensible,06/01/2017,KTallguy,"Great balance of world and local news. I like the format and the guest correspondents. They're flexible and will cover headlines first, but once in awhile they'll do something light hearted. That's welcome in today's world. Up First is now part of my daily routine. Thanks for the voice of sanity, NPR.",5
A new morning ritual,06/01/2017,Wywonder,I am really enjoying this podcast. I have a weird work schedule so I usually miss morning edition when it's on. This is a great morning catch up in NPR style. If you like this podcast you should also listen to NYT's first up. It's also great and a little more in depth on particular topics.,5
Perfect length,06/02/2017,remixin_it,"I like that it's more lighthearted and covers more topics than The NYTs Daily, since I listen to both. It's the perfect length and balance for a quick update.",5
Great way to start the day!,06/02/2017,count_ant,I listen to this podcast every morning; it's a perfect way to get up and going. The hosts cover the top news of the day prior and give you what you need to know for the day ahead.,5
A good overview of top stories,06/02/2017,Lib in SC,"While not the caliber of The Daily, the show has gotten better in the last couple months, and it does give you more of a complete overview of important stories. It's a light tone for the most part, but they're good reporters.",4
Exactly what I want,06/02/2017,helen15,I love how to the point this podcast is. Great to put on when doing morning stretches and it's a welcome relief from traditional morning/evening news stations.,5

Why Choose?,06/03/2017,pamfaulknet,Listen to Up First AND The Daily.,4
"Love it, but...",06/03/2017,Wallyhimself,"Great to wake up to, but since when are there only five days in a week? Does the news stop on Saturday and Sunday? I would have rated it higher if it appeared seven days a week.",4
I love it,06/04/2017,jessicatwg,Best way to start my day. Day doesn't feel likes it's started without it. My only wish is that there were episodes on the weekend!!,5
My go-to morning listen,06/04/2017,Nurse Keith,"As a professional podcaster, I can say without reservations that Up First is the first place I go every morning to get my day going and set my sights on what to pay attention to throughout the day. A new reliable voice in my feed.",5
Top notch,06/05/2017,Highway Henry,This podcast is only 6 episodes in right now but it is fantastic. Assuming this was created to counter The Daily by NYT radio and my goodness does it. The Daily is unbearable after listening to this.,5
Incredibly biased commentary,06/05/2017,Yak dong,About two minutes of news and ten minutes of New York style judgement. Requires listeners to sift through the biased PC commentary for few actual verifiable facts.,1
Great way to get caught up on news,06/05/2017,monkey-pjs,This is an excellent news podcast. It is short and to the point while also going into enough details to help you understand each news story they tackle. I am excited each day by the stories they chose to cover. Keep up the good work.,5
Short and Sweet,06/05/2017,Moops210,This podcast is perfect for my morning. I listen before I read the paper and it helps me understand the news.,5
awesome,06/05/2017,chicago based,listen everyday,5
Your Morning Brief,06/05/2017,PC0ck,This podcast is an awesome way to get your morning news. It's just long enough to give you the info you need but not too long that you lose interest. The hosts do a great job of breaking down the issues so you don't have to be an expert to understand what's going on in the world. Another win from NPR. Thank you for all you do.,5
Love it!,05/26/2017,hcaban,Won't start my day without it. Thank you!,5
The ideal morning news podcast,05/27/2017,Christen1298,"I love this podcast! Its a fun and easy way to get the top headlines in the morning, and I love that it is more casual than NYT's The Daily but still informative and nuanced reporting. Bonus: it's almost exactly the same length as my commute in the morning, so it fits into my schedule perfectly.",5
Best way to start me day!,05/27/2017,MWHoops10,"Quick, easy and exactly the right amount of news.",5
Cutesy and unserious,05/28/2017,Dr. &y,"The NYT one is way better. ""Up First"" gives no more depth or context than I can get from skimming headlines.",2
Listen every morning!,05/28/2017,OR Liz,Great way to stay on top of the news.,5
My favorite shady news anchors,05/29/2017,The Evil Gentleman,I appreciate that they aren't all stuffy and uptight. They aren't scared to throw a little shade at certain politicians who deserve it.,5
Good prospectus of morning edition,05/29/2017,MorimotoJute,And they work on national holidays. So there's that too.,5
Every Morning,05/30/2017,ShanLest,Every morning I start with NPR UpFirst.,5
I recommend,05/30/2017,wcg49,Great program. Gives you a brief summary of the major stories of the day. I listen every day.,5
I listen to this back to back with The Daily,05/30/2017,Kek0866,"I love this podcast and listen to it right before or after The Daily. It's nice that the stories covered don't overlap or repeat very often. Overall, great little morning news update!",5
Awesome!,05/30/2017,DaleObie,"A generous portion of important news stories, a dash of pop culture, and a perfect mix of humor and awesome rapport. I love it!",5
Great Preview of the Day,05/31/2017,Placmb,I listen to Up First every morning. This gives a brief preview of 2-3 items and what you need to know about them. It helps me to then know what to listen for throughout the day from various news sources. A number of people have commented about The Daily which I listen to every morning too. I find the two podcasts cover similar material but in different ways. They complement each other well.,5
Good way to start your day,05/31/2017,msbbd559,"Very informative, gives you easy summaries of the biggest things happening",5
Excellent,05/31/2017,Jewels200,I look forward to listening every morning and think the reporting and contributors are excellent!,5
Brief and Upbeat,05/31/2017,Cool G,This podcast gives just enough information for me to decide if I want to know more of each story. I enjoy the hosts and the interaction between them. Five stars.,5
"The Daily is 5 stars, I give this 4.",06/01/2017,Brendan Keene,"Listen to The NY Times ""the Daily"" right after. MUCH BETTER",4
Love it,06/01/2017,Meg with Four,"Short - just the right serving size of news with my morning coffee.
Intelligent - a knowledgeable review of the headlines of the day.",5
Biased but informative,06/01/2017,TAdaBOSS,"I enjoy listening to NPR, they have a great broad coverage of much of the current events. However, though they once aimed to be quasi-neutral, they have clearly given up that approach and push a left agenda unashamedly",4
For those who keep comparing it to the daily,06/01/2017,Dr.PHeshIPhoneapps,It's not. Get over it. Overall I enjoy Up First for the fact that it is more concise than The Daily. I'm a subscriber and listener of both podcasts but each serves their purpose. The Daily on average is a full 10 minutes longer than Up First so of course Up First can't be as in depth. Good Podcast ignore the less than 4 star reviews.,5
wolfehowls,06/01/2017,awolfehowls,Great way to catch news highlights on the way to work. Love it!,5
High quality daily pod,05/23/2017,Max RF,Thank you for bringing real news to the air waves!,5
Part of my daily routine,05/23/2017,Mark from Iowa,I listen to podcasts all the time and have never written a review but I have to for Up First. It's the quick dose of news I need to wake up and be a productive member of society.,5
Thanks!,05/24/2017,reenzta,I love that this is shorter than the daily it's easy to listen to and I prefer it to other NPR podcasts I've listened to though I still love and appreciate those. Thanks for the great work NPR!,5
Why so many negative reviews?,05/24/2017,Penguinigurl,"For me, this podcast is perfect. I want to stay up-to-date on national and international news but am also extremely busy. I can listen to Up First on my way to work for a quick, straightforward rundown on the big stories for the day. If I want more information about a particular story, I can follow up once I know the basics. I tried listening to The Daily as well but feel that NPR takes the prize for the more efficient and unbiased reporting on this one.",5
"Great content, producers beware.",05/24/2017,AJCarro1,"I've really enjoyed the format of this podcast. As an independent, I'm actively seeking a non biased news source, as many others undoubtedly are. It's my hope that this podcast ignores the temptation to put any spin on its reporting.",4
The best 10-12 minutes of my day.,05/24/2017,DLSweet45,"I love listening to this podcast. It gives comprehensive reports of the day's news.
It's relatively short compared to ""The Daily"", but I like that. The anchors and the reporters are personable and easy to understand.",5
Great podcast BUT,05/24/2017,surenec,Great podcast BUT the background music is VERY annoying. The music is so much of a nuisance that I will not listen to this podcast anymore.,3
Perfect length,05/24/2017,Dssknits,I really like the short format. I can hear about the top three issues of the day and still hear local traffic and weather on my commute. Most other podcasts way too long.,5
Very Good!,05/25/2017,turtlesmakecheese,This quick news update podcast does a very good job of covering a few basic trending news items each day. When the podcast first began they ended each one with a happy story (like full length broadcasts do) which I did not like and I am so glad they dropped that. That extra fluff was wasting my time! It's great just hearing the news items. Keep it up NPR!,5
Quick & Easy News,05/25/2017,StreetField,Short and concise the podcast gives you a few trending headlines/stories without going into too much depth.,5
"Content good, music bad.",05/25/2017,Ouhouston,Please change your intro music. It really is not a good fit for this format. Makes me want to turn the podcast off before it evens starts. Just saying.,4
Nice way to keep informed,05/25/2017,Ringmail Honeymeade,So easy to spend less than 15 minutes keeping abreast of the current stories.,5
Makes the news palatable right now,05/25/2017,Sysaphis,I can't stand listening to or reading the news right now. This is a quick way to stay updated and not get overwhelmed by all the craziness.,3
Amazing podcast,05/25/2017,ZackSmithwood,Everyone should listen to this podcast,5
Love this podcast,05/25/2017,Fauxcheffor5,First thing I listen too every morning. Thank you!,5
Same old,05/25/2017,Booploopscrochet,Lefty take on the news.,1
Smart and concise,05/26/2017,Pixelriffic,Been looking for a podcast like this for a long time. Look forward to it each morning now.,5
Great start to my day,05/26/2017,Denver Razorback,Great overview of the day's news. Just what I was looking for,5
"Light, cutesy, annoying, but...",05/26/2017,RobertJDickinson,"Good content constantly undermined by annoyingly cutesy and ""up"" chatter wrap-around and music. Today Show wannabe, I guess.",2
Great summary to start my morning,05/26/2017,ChillBill69,Awesome,5
excellent commute listen,05/20/2017,VicRig,Great way to absorb the headlines. Top pressing current events and an occassial human interest snack. I appreciate the conversational tone and witty comments.,5
Excellent!,05/20/2017,superflychild,"Listen to this every morning before The Daily. This is more of a summary of headlines, while the Daily deep dives on a topic.",5
Great morning news brief!,05/21/2017,Djdjwbdo,This show's hosts makes today's news bearable! Their voices are pleasing and their style with news presentation my choice to turn to first each morning.,5
A Whole Week On Trump,05/21/2017,PeterInfant,"I subscribed to this podcast becuase I beleived this was a source of good news. The way it is advertised makes you think that you will receive the information that is important for that day, the latest new. After waking up and listening to upfirst for a whole week straight all I received were daily updates on Donald Trump (not that these are unimportant, but this podcast is in no way balanced in really delivering important information). Sorry up first, you lost a subscriber.",1
Love it,05/21/2017,John in broward,Awesome pod cast,5
Great Podcast!,05/21/2017,BigFeeesh,"This is the first podcast I listen to every weekday morning. The podcast consistenly chooses important headlines and the level of discussion of each topic is perfect (and far more in-depth than I expected considering the short amount of time). If you're looking for a detailed discussion on a news story, this podcast isn't it, but it's a great way to quickly become informed on major headlines in an intelligent and enjoyable way.",5
The Perfect Podcast for Folks with Anxiety,05/21/2017,defyinggravitee,"If you, like me, have chronic anxiety and can't engage with current events for more than about ten minutes without experiencing debilitating anxiety attacks, but you also feel a responsibility to stay informed, Up First is the perfect podcast for you. It gives you the facts you need to keep up with all the major news in one short, convenient daily package, and you can feel confident that it's coming from a reliable source. Also, the hosts are charming, and the terrible events of the world seem just a little less terrible when delivered in David Greene's smooth, sonorous voice.",5
Love the hosts,05/22/2017,JenJenDC,"It's quick and easy to listen to - a good way to get the highlights of the day.

I really enjoy the neutral sound of the hosts, though they must have some political bend. They try to point out the inconsistencies of the information being shared around some current events, but also will mention the fact that others have acted in a similar way.",4
Quick and Great,05/22/2017,Chicostix89,"In just under 12 minutes NPR hits you with the Top 3 headlines of today's news. It's my first news in the morning!! Just wish it covered the weekends, but I understand we all need some days off!",5
Great overview of the news,05/22/2017,bonnie_mellon,Great!! Listen every morning,5
Start Your Morning with a Quick Update from NPR,05/22/2017,jadecoppieters,I love listening to Up First as I run in the morning. It's fast and I know I can trust NPR to be relatively unbiased.,5
Pretty good,05/22/2017,Kellen R.,Not bad. I like how short it is,4
Karenpcheng,05/23/2017,Karenpcheng,My favorite thing is the theme music! Sometimes I listen just for that :).,4
"Big NPR fan, but this doesn't help me",05/23/2017,dak52,"I get up for work at 5:20. This show isn't out yet so I just listen to the newscast on the NPR app. The newscast is a little shorter but tends to be a bit more dense. Props to NPR for trying new things, but this doesn't meet my needs.",3
Good intro to the news,05/23/2017,Yrallthenamestakn,"Great program, covers pop culture as well as more important global events, which some criticize. Definitely a survey of headlines more than a discussion, as the short length would suggest, but listen to it in combo with NYT's The Daily, and you'll be set for your day.",4
"I want to like this podcast, but...",05/23/2017,Mothy le Sunn,"This podcast can be painful to listen to. I get some news and analysis on Up First that aren't on the NYT Daily, but it's hardly worth the campy jokes. Trash like, ""I just got back from the Middle East and now the President is there!"" Or ""‚ÄîThank god it's Friday, right Rachel? ‚ÄîThe day isn't over yet, David!"" I listen because I want the news in a quick format, not because of the personalities involved. Especially when those jokes do nothing to advance the story. Get to the point and cut the crap.",2
Leans more to the left each day.,05/23/2017,Jshzhahashausgwh,I was excited to finally find a quick unbiased source of news for my mornings and followed this closely for a while. Day by day it's just going more off the rails with a blatant agenda against Trump.,2
"Great, concise look at the day's news!",05/23/2017,LSH218,"Great, concise look at the day's news!",5
Great start to the day,05/23/2017,Chris0928,Great start to the day,5
Perfect,05/23/2017,Krasavyets,My favorite podcast on the way to work. Good balance of national and global news.,5
Runner up to NPR's hourly summary,05/17/2017,AppsShouldPayMe,I appreciate that most people want insights into what news means but I shy away from the assumptions that get made. Thought this could be a good replacement to the hourly update but it's not.,2
Great overview,05/17/2017,ButlerGSU,It's a great overview of top stories. I like to listen during my warmup before going on to move in depth podcasts.,5
No Time for Second,05/17/2017,Voice_of_Democracy,"Great podcast. Quick, informative, lively and the hosts do a great job with just the right amount of banter and informative dialogue. FANTASTIC!!!",5
Perfect way to start the day,05/18/2017,Nich337,"I'm guilty of falling behind following the news, and Up First has been the perfect solution. It's short enough that I can listen while I'm getting ready for work, and I feel more informed about what's going on.",5
Awesome new addition!,05/18/2017,cris0405,Love the new show! Great energy & stories.,5
The best.,05/18/2017,kate.woodbury,Love it.,5
Great quick daily news segment!,05/18/2017,Sammiiibby,"I started listening to The Daily first as we all did, until this podcast came out. While the other podcast sometimes dives deep into specific articles that aren't actually daily news, Up First ALWAYS brings you a quick update on the days news. I love that it gives you enough information in a short amount of time. I start my day with this on my drive to work so I can make sure I'm not missing any of the headliner news. Great work guys, keep up the consistency of just daily news.",5
Five stars from a Political Science major,05/18/2017,larkinluna,"Edit: many people are upset that pop stars like Beyonc√© are mentioned in this short 10 minute podcast. I don't care much for her music or that side of pop culture, but I'm really glad that Up First includes this type of content for exactly that reason. Someone in my class brought up her album Lemonade the next week and I completely understood the reference - whereas before I would have missed what they were talking about. I know to many this isn't important, but I think that's a vital part of what Up First is. Keep up the good work NPR!!",5
Great addition to my morning routine,05/18/2017,music_is_essential,"This podcast, along with Democracy Now! and NYT's The Daily is how I get most of my news when I'm commuting.",5
Just found THE DAILY,05/18/2017,Mint2tch,I thought this was okay... until I found NYT the daily. Such a more balanced take on the news! I will not miss the snarky giggling of the NPR.,2
Too deep & narrow,05/18/2017,ktop1,"To live up to the promise of bringing the most important news of the day, this show needs to talk about more than 2-3 stories per episode. I think 4-5 would be more helpful, but I'd also be happy with a headline bullet list at the end of each episode so I at least know what to investigate farther. I think I'd rather have this show serve as my news ""agenda"" for the day than as a discussion of the top two stories.",3
Love this podcast!,05/19/2017,Jamandymoo3,"I have a hard time listening to news throughout the day (especially lately) because it's a little too focused on every small detail of the current president. I love listening to this podcast in the morning to get the main points. If I feel compelled to learn more I'll read up on the news. If not, I can focus on other podcasts.",5
"more, more, please, this format is so great",05/19/2017,matthew.daniel,"Like the other commenters, I have longed for a Morning Edition podcast, because being by my radio or stream is trickier in the morning, but thanks to Up First I can now get the tl;dr from the voices I trust. And the format is so great: it moves much faster than the over-the-air segments, (made more awesome by the 1.5x on my podcast app!) and doesn't seem to have any filler.",5
Excellent way to start the day,05/19/2017,toheckwithnickname,Interesting and fair synopsis. I find it to be unbiased and on point.,5
Timely and to the point,05/19/2017,Hands had,It has quickly become my morning routine to listen to this first every day. I only wish it were also on Saturday! Thank you for this reliably early-morning addition.,5
Less opinions please!,05/19/2017,Kkopping,I'm looking for fewer pieces of commentary and more factual based information. The journalists opinions in this podcast are typically conveyed in tone/pitch and carefully selected adjectives and verbs. I had hoped to have found an unbiased source of news this podcast but ended up unsubscribing after only two weeks.,1
Achieves its goal,05/19/2017,professorplum91,"I have about a twenty minute commute in the morning and this podcast is just what I need to stay up to date in the world. With each episode lasting about about 13 minutes, it's a great way to start the day. Well done!",5
Good morning start,05/19/2017,lb19999,"NPR's team does a good job of highlighting important news, and often with knowledgeable experts in the studio to provide important context and opinion. Thanks team!! Good way to start the morning while my coffee is brewing.",4
Great way to start the day!,05/19/2017,Berner owner,Love listening to NPR in the car but my toddler doesn't always allow it. I can quickly get caught up on the major news of the day during my commute. Keep up the good work NPR!,5
Music,05/19/2017,Elissa 83,"I appreciate the effort, but guys, you have to change this music. Also you don't need to tell us all the news. That's what the news is for. Give us some depth, do something different then what you're going to do in an hour.",3

Just right.,05/16/2017,TheMacNerd,"The content is great and the time spent on each topic is great for my short commute.

Great in conjunction with the daily,05/16/2017,Lilysf12,"Love this podcast. NPR just knows how to do engaging and high quality radio. This is quick and covers more topics than the daily. I don't think they should be compared--entirely different podcasts, IMO. I listen to Up First, then the Daily every morning and it's a wonderful start to my day!!",5
Not News,05/16/2017,Tulliandar,"They promise the days most important news stories, but it's really far-left propaganda, and fluff pieces.",1
Format,05/16/2017,MathNomad,"For podcasts, format is king. This is great for when I roll out of bed, turn on coffee, and get out the door for work. No crazy sound editing. No crazy editorials. Just the basic guts of what to expect in the day's news.",5

Helpful and efficient,05/17/2017,Topofthecharts5,Great pod to get the news!,5
Click Bait.,05/17/2017,Mainesummer1,Great idea-but this show has become another Trump reality show. Where is the international analysis? Where are the stories that impact the tax payers directly that support NPR? Where is the approach to bring the citizenry together ? A shameful approach to journalism.,1

Excellent,05/17/2017,sunflower bec,"Excellent. Just enough news and just enough commentary to get me started on days I don't have time (or energy!) for longer listens or reads. Would love a re-evaluation of the theme music, though.",5
Perfect length,05/17/2017,wingilote,Perfect length to start the day,5
Not very bipartisan,05/17/2017,Brad13212,They don't do a very good job at just stating the facts or at least investigating things from multiple sides of the political array. Too liberal for me.,1
Efficient & effective news blast,05/13/2017,AliceJJJJ,I listen to this and the morning Hourly News during my commute to work to keep myself updated. I appreciate how you cherry pick the most important news stories for me; it can be hard to choose which stories to follow with so much information out there. I've successfully converted my roommate into a regular listener as well.,5
The bomb,05/13/2017,bluetrainfive,"This podcast brings the NPR giants in a short format, it works!",5
Not bad but the Daily is better,05/13/2017,OGHowie,"This is basically NPR's answer to the Daily, which makes sense since I stopped listening to NPR One in the morning when The Daily came out. Show is not bad but they can probably do with just one host. They end up talking over each other quite often.",4

One of my Daily Must-Have Podcasts.,05/14/2017,Shapcomp,"I have listened to this podcast from the first day it was on the air, and I love it. In less than the time it takes me to eat my breakfast, I get my dose of real news from one of the most respected news sources in the United States. Between this podcast and The Daily, t, a similar short podcast offered by the New York Times, I feel I have the basics to get me started. I supplement the two with longer podcasts by the New York Times, NPR, and the New Yorker, and I feel I am equipped with the information needed to handle this country's current turbulent politics.",5
Just what I need,05/14/2017,AJBR76,"I really like Up First - it gives me just what I need on days when I don‚Äôt have time to read the news in depth. The Morning Edition hosts are all great, and I like the more relaxed early-morning tone. Even the music is good! I think they generally make sensible story selections, and have no objection to them doing a lighter story for the last couple of minutes, especially on days when there‚Äôs less serious news.",5
"Great show, terrible music",05/14/2017,Fishbowl27813,"Love the quick-hit nature of this show, covering the day's events. Great topics and well delivered, with several different specialists coming on to offer their views. Good stuff overall, but the intro/outro music sounds like something from an '80s drum machine.

Pretty good morning run down,05/12/2017,JCinman,"Like others have said, this is not quite as informative as NYT's The Daily. Part of that could be because it never breaks past 12 or 13 minutes long. That said, it's still worth listening to most days.",4
Grateful,05/12/2017,Above-average Joe,"I love this quick, morning glimpse from the NPR team.
Thank you all and keep up the great work.",5
Wake Up with First Up,05/12/2017,Disappointed candy queen,I've been enjoying this short form news cast as my morning shower listening. It helps me to start the day informed and ready to go.,5
Perfect News Starter for non-news people,05/12/2017,rjmurray87,"If you're like me and never really listened to the news a lot, this will be a great introduction for you into that world. It's certainly not a comprehensive view of the current events, but they don't make that claim that it will be. Give it a try. Worst case, you don't like it and move on. Best case, you'll dig it and stay subscribed and a bit better informed.",5
Looking forward to this more and more.,05/12/2017,Citizen Cyber,It's now the first pod I open in the morning. A concise bite of the day's top news focus.,5
Really good. Really fun. Thank you!,05/12/2017,Creative Task Master,"With the possible exception of the pop-culture story that is always in the mix, I'm really enjoying Up First. Don't get me wrong, I like pop-culture (it's part of how I make a living) but I'm not sure it counts as news or should be in this podcast. That said, the coverage feels fluid and complete, the hosts seem to enjoy each other and I find it very informative. I also LOVE the theme song (and keep humming it even when I'm not listening to the show). This podcast is a good way to keep me up to date on some top stories every day. Much appreciated.",4
A quick introduction to the days News.,05/12/2017,MAD2Art,"This is a short, but thorough overview of some important news for the day. Perfect amount of time to have my coffee and breakfast. It has become the first thing I listen to in the morning.",5
Good short bites...,05/12/2017,TinkxLaryn,Gives good short bites that are similar but from a different perspective as those given by the Daily. They have improved a lot over the last weeks. I like that they cover different news.,4
Not News,05/12/2017,emeon,I thought this would be a good news podcast to get caught up with current events but it's all opinion. There's simply too much commentary and not enough facts. Not going to waste my time with this one.,1
Great start to my day!,05/12/2017,ibritten80,I listen to Up First every morning :D,5
Great source of daily news,05/12/2017,Dave C (Penn),Up First is a great source of daily news. I listen on my commute into work every morning. It's a great way to stay on top of general news topics. While not in depth (given the short length) it does offer great breadth.,5

Morning Commute - Done,05/12/2017,Chris Faranetta,Great insight and great way to start the day.,5
Great start,05/12/2017,Evy1220,"Love the quick update on the day. The only recommendation I would make is cut back on the music, or at least lower the volume. It is much louder than the voice volume. It is so loud it distracts from the commentary at the beginning, and makes the hosts hard to hear. Music layered over voices with both at the same volume is very hard to comprehend and triggers headaches. I have not played the podcast some days because I don't want to deal with having to fast forward through the music at the start.",3
Love the quick way to know what I need to know!,05/12/2017,pb918918,What I really like about Up First is that I want to stay informed on the most important topics but I don't want to be listening to all the news all the time and I don't want to get caught up too much.,5
Good way to start the day,05/12/2017,nolacameragirl,"A good clean bite of daily information presented in a conversational way. I have listened to every single episode since they recently started and plan to continue doing so. One downside, I don't love their theme music.",5
Best way to start my day!,05/12/2017,kfryer2012,I really enjoy this podcast. It's always less than 15 minutes and all of the contributors are very knowledgeable about the topics they speak on.

"Informational, Usually",05/12/2017,mwb524,"I listen to both Up First and The Daily on my way to work. I like how the The Daily goes into more depth on their stories, but I also like the quick summation of major headlines that Up First provides. Good",5
Morning Kickstart,05/12/2017,Whistlingmike,"What a great way to start the day. For more than 6-months now, there seems to be multiple large important stories each day so it is hard to get a more in-depth backstory to what would be the most important story from the previous before. I have come to rely on NPR's ""Up First"" to get this every morning before the day gets away from me.",5

Really Fabulous,05/11/2017,jodeco,"I love this podcast! In the fifteen minutes it takes me to get ready in the morning, I'm primed on the major news stories of the day. Not too shallow, not too deep on anything; solid anchoring and even some field reporting. If something piques my interst, I can easily go hunting for it later in the day, having been primed by Up First. Great podcast!",5

Great way to start the day,05/12/2017,mgr283,"Love this podcast. I've been listening every morning as I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get ready to go.

Great start to the day,05/12/2017,Beckys review,"As someone who can't take too much news in this era of news overload, this is a great way to get caught up on major events every day.",5
"Quick, informative but needs a posititive",05/12/2017,Twirllvcteach,"I really enjoy this podcast because it allows me to catch up on big stories daily, in what I feel is an unbiased format. With a busy schedule, I am able to still get the necessary news on my way to work. Much of the news in our country can be negative or cause tension. I would love if the last minute or two of the broadcast focused on a positive or ""feel good"" story/event. This would set listeners up with a positive outlook, hope, and encouragement each day, something we need more of in today's society.",4
Enjoy this Addition,05/12/2017,TravelBrenda,Unlike other new daily podcasts this one is a surface look at key news events. I go to others for the deep dive OR try to make sure I catch NPR's morning and evening broadcasts. But if I need to catch up because my schedule didn't allow me to hear those ... I find it valuable! Well-reported as always.,5
NPR Politics Podcast Light,05/12/2017,TeeterPotter,Up First should be called NPR Politics Podcast Light because 85% of their stories are about politics. It goes along with the rest of the news outlets as far as a takeover by Trump and his terrible presidency but overall I like the journalist and the fact that it's a short podcast,4
Good quick summary,05/12/2017,Elizafith,Good summary of the news of the day.,5

Good if repetitive,05/12/2017,Huntcw,"It's a good place to start, unfortunately after listening to the podcast I often turn on the NPR One app--which is awesome--only to hear longer versions of the exact same stories. Still if time is short this should be your go to!",5
This works for what I was looking for,05/08/2017,colorcrystals,"I wanted a podcast that would provide a quick overview on some of the big news stories I need to keep an eye on throughout the day, and this fit the bill!

Up First vs The Daily,05/10/2017,Robert578,"I've listened to up first for a couple weeks but read in the reviews people liked The Daily. I went over there to have a listen and.. I like it better, more story telling of the days news. This is decent but it's reminds me of media outlets on Cartoons if that makes sense.",3
"Not impressed, especially for NPR",05/10/2017,KA1122334455,"This show should be called trump first. It's √ºber political and highly liberal. I was hoping for factual news over a broad range of international topics and less analytical commentary from the hosts. I hardly feel equipped to go about my day, armed with the most important news stories on my mind. Here's to hoping its revamped in the near future.",3

Fantastic way to start the day!,05/11/2017,CraftyRooster,I'm a long time NPR listener but I don't have a ton of time in the mornings. The first thing I do when I wake up is hit play on the day's episode of Up First and in 15 mins I'm caught up on all the important news of the day. The only downside is it's just a Monday through Friday show. Keep up the great work guys!,5
Great start to my morning!,05/11/2017,jaaaaaaaaake,I love this podcast. It squeezes all of the important news for the day into a short podcast to start my morning.,5
A daily brief. Fast moving. Forward thinking.,05/11/2017,BC_boston,"Excellent format. Daily release is early enough that it can impact my day. Gets in front of the day's news, instead of reporting on yesterday's news. Has quickly become a part of my daily commute. I actually listen to it before I turn on the radio.",5

Great Daily Mews Podcast,05/11/2017,Enigma47,"While this isn't like NYT's The Daily per se, I like having an initial, concise summary of the news rather than something like the Daily to start off my day.

Great way to catch up,05/04/2017,dylankarzen,"I think this podcast is a succinct slice of what NPR brings. It is great reporting with a touch of self awareness. It can occasionally tend towards a bit jocular, but on the whole, it is a great way to know what to watch for the rest of the day.",4
Does it's job.,05/05/2017,Hrhment,"This cast is what it says it is. I have seen it compared to The Daily, but I like this much better. The stories are concise bullet points and they really do cover everything important. If you're mad they talked about Beyonc√© it only lasts a second. Whereas with The Daily you may be stuck with a 10 minute irrelevant story about uber.",5
First podcast of the morning,05/05/2017,4thmonthgirl,"Folks are giving bad reviews because they barely mentioned Beyonc√© once? People are ridiculous self important d-bags. NPR is wonderful always, even if they dared to think Beyonc√© was worthy of 30 seconds of airtime one day.",5

What I've Been Missing,05/05/2017,RollTide-Meagan,"Thank you NPR! I commute to work daily, and I have long desired for a quick and easy way to listen to the day's headlines. Up First has become a part of my morning routine!",5

I like the conversational style!",5
Squandered opportunity,05/02/2017,ToneDeafRabbitt,"Took about 1 minute, twenty seconds to start reporting. This is completely opposite to what has already been learned by big media outlets. Morning news must be succinct and promptly delivered. Sponsorships come in different ways, briefer, after top story OR you will never have a big enough audience to demand high sponsorship dollars. That's what this is about right? It's certainly not to provide a service nobody else is providing. Softer NPR- style news in the morning would be appreciated -- that's why I tried but then deleted it.",2

Quick info,05/02/2017,Na-tek,Very short podcast usually around 10 minutes. I love this podcast for days when I just don't have time to listen to the full news.

Great way to get my news,04/28/2017,Figure HDTV,"This is a great way to get the top headlines for the day. I like that it is pushed out early, so I can listen to it on my way into work. I figure out what is going on and if there's anything I need to do more research into during the day.",4

Great Way to Start the Day!,05/01/2017,Miss Boo Boo Dog,"This is a great podcast to start the day. It provides a quick overview on the important issues of the day. Not too long. I'd give it five stars, if they changed that weird, lead-in and transition music.",4
Skip it- unless into Fluff news,05/01/2017,Jalin Ma,Seriously? This is considered most Impt news of the day to know in 10 min? Skip it & listen to Democracy Now Headlines.

Unfortunate,05/01/2017,childish drivel,"Tried to like this but have finally given up. Will stick with the NYT's The Daily, a vastly better podcast. NPR news once was the gold standard.

Up First?,05/02/2017,Kc5wmm,"I was excited about this podcast when I first heard about it, as I am a Audible subscriber I get the NYT free every morning. What I have found out is that the NYT is released between 0330-0400 CT and Up First is released much later so I never get to download it until the evening due to having to get to work so early. If this podcast is going to be successful, I think it will need to be released much earlier, in the meantime, maybe change the name to Up Second?",2

Perfect,04/27/2017,Sinds Nacks,Perfect for the morning. Sometimes they focus on an item I consider to be a little less immediately important but overall it's a great little dose of news.,5
Listen to The Daily,04/28/2017,Zbmac31,"The way these stories are reported is like the guy is just get through it. Also in the 12 minutes of ""news to get you through the day"" why would you feel people need to know Beyonc√© is pregnant or Kendrick Lamar dropped a new album? There's no depth to any story which I guess if you just want, hey this is what happened, then by all means. If you want real news listen to The Daily.",1

I now listen to Up First and The Daily every weekday morning. I enjoy both the depth and width of the topics. It mentions more than political news, but also social and cultural ones.

Nothing special. Subscribe to the daily,04/20/2017,PhD student USA-UK-Uganda,How is this any different than the hourly update or just morning edition? It's a sloppy attempt to compete with NYT The Daily and not any different than just listening to the other podcasts or hourly updates.,1

Nice start to the day,04/19/2017,Chrisinthe305,The podcast comes at a good time in the morning so I can start my day with the latest news. Just a couple topics to keep me informed delivered in a very easy to listen format.,5
Pass,04/19/2017,PatNorrisJr,Boring,2
Just give the News,04/19/2017,Jsf306,Annoying personalities who just need to give the news...not their dumb jokes or personal opinions.,1
I love being informed!,04/20/2017,RecentListener,This podcast is the best way to start my day.,5
Quick and to the point,04/20/2017,JLPoo31,I enjoy listening to this podcast every morning. It keeps me up on current events by keeping the program brief. This keeps me from feeling like I'm burdened with too much information while listening to long drawn out and boring commentary.,5
It's OK,04/20/2017,Speedie80,"It's all right to give some highlights, the problem is that it still has the same tone as if they were going to be on an hour-long show so it's still moves slowly and they waste time with music interludes, time that could be spent giving me more information. I expected it to be a little more succinct, a little more to the point, less banter, just information. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because it's a new show but I expect that if things remain the same I will be unsubscribing and sticking to my other Podcasts",3
Bias,04/20/2017,PAC45,Might as well be MSNBC,1
Still Trying It Out,04/20/2017,WSRitterLane,"Not quite what I expected. I wanted more headline news. One news reader would be fine.
Just need the facts without analysis or interviewing of reporters. Not covering as much news in ten minutes as I had hoped. Disappointed but at this point still listening.",1
It's not the Daily...,04/20/2017,LlamaBites86,...and they don't have the days episode ready when I'm driving to work.,2
Expected more from it.,04/20/2017,Benchwarmer,"I was honestly really excited when this podcast came out - and I times I love episodes. However, the show is just too politically biased and focused for me to consider it a true daily update. Really wish they would take a more broad and neutral approach to it.",2
Not as good as The Daily from NY times,04/20/2017,Lisapet2727,I'm trying to give this show a chance since I love NPR. But I wake up and I'm excited to listen to The Daily from the NY Times. Up first just doesn't compare.,2
"Carbon Copy of ""The Daily""",04/13/2017,pixelwookie99,"NPR's version of The NYT's The Daily. If you want NPR news, listen to the Hourly News Summary.",1
Just right!,04/13/2017,ScienceStorm,"Just the right length. Just the right amount of detail, not so long that the crap news is too depressing. Cheerful voices and great panelists.",5
"""Good morning, welcome to the dumpster fire""",04/13/2017,Amiedame,"Appreciate this quick rundown of the day's most important stories, even if it's a brutal way to start the day. Of course it's not the podcast's fault that everything is terrifying. Also, the lighthearted tidbit at the end of each episode is not necessary. It is more of an annoyance than the antidote I think it's intended to be. I have been turning it off early.",3
Stick to the Daily,04/13/2017,Bridgie S,"I did not care for this show. I like Beyonc√©, but I don't think her Birthday present to her husband, is news I need to know.",1
Some continuity please,04/13/2017,Jeasgr,On April 12 %80 of the show was about the Russia-US meeting that was going happen later that day and the implications of it. On April 13 it's not even mentioned at all. It's like come on! You gave me the build up and then just skipped it? This got me annoyed enough to go search for another podcast.,2
Meh,04/13/2017,Hjdhsklsnslahxjc,Pretty much just another NPR politics podcast.,2
Liberal bias,04/13/2017,heathrbarr,If you like a liberal slant to your news...subscribe. Don't expect objective reporting.,1
Kinda light,04/13/2017,Jgw;o),I want full strength NPR in the morning.,2
A great start to the morning,04/14/2017,SuperK88,This Podcast is great for a quick rundown of headlines with the journalists involved in the stories that are shared. I listen first thing in the morning when waking up. It's nice to have a nice shorter podcast when I don't have time for 30-60 mins of listening. Sometimes I will even listen on the short 15 min commute to work and it's gets me through the drag of traffic.,5
That music! Ooph.,04/14/2017,Lynn890,Hard to get past the opening story because of the music.,3
News snapshot to start the day,04/14/2017,avpb@sarasota,Provides a nice summary of the important news events to monitor during the day. Summarizes key events into a well packaged format.,4
+1 for being NPR,04/14/2017,BLs4EVERY1-420,"Lets be honest, nobody should be this happy about the news. Personally, just hoped for more.",2
Excellent starter set!,04/14/2017,Alexzndr,Just the way to get things going.,5
love it!,04/14/2017,LBELL00,i listen to this pod every morning while eating breakfast! it's got a little bit of everything-- from world news to pop culture. helps me stay informed in a fast paced news world!,5
Not up to NPR standards,04/14/2017,Audionews,"Disappointed. Zero info on the Gorsuch nomination/""nuclear option"" on 4/7's update but tons on Facebook. And please stop with the Beyonc√© and pop culture updates. That's not news. That's the fluff I'm seeking to avoid with a succinct news update. Update- thought this week was better but then we get Kendrick Lemar Seriously, you claim this is ""the news you need to know"". I have no problem with a Morning Edition story on these pop culture icons, but it's not the top news anyone ""needs to know"". Unsubscribing",1
If hourly update and NPR politics,04/15/2017,Patchoulidrop,"had a baby. Nothing new, really, and not up first--it's not ready when I'm ready for morning news. With all the adverts it's not really more than the hourly, anyway.",3
Great Morning Podcast,04/16/2017,Tillyato,Very informative and the perfect length. Great way to educate yourself on the main news events of the day while getting ready for work.,5
Just what I needed,04/16/2017,pmpearson,"I play this as soon as I start my commute and it enables me to know at least the basics of the important things going on in the world that day. With Trump as president, it's more important to me than ever that I'm able to keep up.",5
Great NPR content and analysis,04/17/2017,CBB772,"Up first is exactly what I've been looking for; an NPR news podcast, every morning that I can listen to on the bus. Plus, with the NPR politics podcast and Marketplace, I can get a 360 perspective of the news on my way to work.",5
Sorry but you lost me with Kendrick Lamar,04/18/2017,freezing transplant,"I suscribed to this based on the premise that this short podcast would contain brief coverage of the most important stories of the day. With SO MUCH of importance going on, the fact that you spent almost equal time on Kendrick Lamar's new album made me unsubscribe immediately. If I wanted fluff, arts, music, or 'human interest' stories, I would listen to the three hours of Morning Edition that my local NPR station plays. Very disappointing, NPR.",1
Gutted right,04/10/2017,ythuyud,Great for typing rrtdt re to fret,4
Keeps me from Twitter binging,04/11/2017,CathChick,"Twelve minutes of sane news in the morning rather than an hour watching cable or scrolling through twitter? Yes please. Sane, brief news coverage I can keep up with. Thanks!",5
Delivers as promised,04/11/2017,BlakeinDenver,"A great summary of the daily news. Obviously a lot of stuff doesn't make the cut from morning edition but that's what you would expect for something that's intentionally only 10 minutes long. To everyone comparing this to The Daily: this is an entirely different kind of thing. The daily goes deep on one or two stories, whereas this is a broader discussion of more stories at once.",5
Essential,04/11/2017,Sarahkillzombiez,"Love this! Short enough to be consumable without taking too much time from my other morning podcasts, but a perfect way to get the essential news in an intelligent way. It's becoming as important as a cup of coffee to start my day!",5
Worst NPR show I've ever listened to,04/11/2017,linger25,"I was looking forward to listening to this podcast in the morning. But shockingly, the program is just so bad beyond my imagination. The episode was filled with biased comments and news reporting attitudes. The two hosts are just the worst, bringing down my great impression of the the entire NPR news department. Urrrrrr, don't listen to this morning news show unless you want your entire day to start feeling nauseous.",1
"Not the Daily, and it doesn't need to be!",04/11/2017,tinmanalex,"If you need a quick morning round up of the top news of the day, this is fantastic.

The Daily is fantastic too, but sometimes gets too mired in the weeds for someone who just wants a quick recap.",5
Too One-sided,04/11/2017,TBuckey,"This had great potential, but it bashes too much on the right side, which left a nasty taste in my mouth. I'm more in the middle, and was hoping this podcast would fall along those lines, but it's anything but that. They bash on Trump for 90% of their segments, they mentioned news about Beyonc√© that wasn't really news-worthy, and I feel as though it's more of a political show as opposed to general news. Wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for unbiased news that catches you up on the major events to know.",1
Boring,04/11/2017,Mumford&daughters,I came here excited because I love NPR's podcasts but I feel like this is an attempt at a ripoff of The Daily and it does a poor job. I feel that the news is irrelevant and I am bored the entire time.,2
"Concept Good, Execution Poor",04/11/2017,Kip Jenkins,"I've listened to five episodes, and this podcast isn't worthy of NPR. Roughly 2.5 minutes devoted to each topic and the discussion is neither new nor provocative. I'll spend my mornings more productively by going elsewhere for news. Unsubscribed.",2
Not my jawn.,04/11/2017,morganfitzp,The stories that get repeated on NPR's big news shows all day long are the parts I'd rather skip. So I'm skipping out on this podcast.,3
Great morning show!,04/11/2017,VPeabody,Love the hosts! Love the show!,5
Check out The Daily instead,04/11/2017,Leprekahn7,"I generally love NPR programs like hidden brain but this one was a miss for me. If you're looking for a short daily news program, The New York Times Daily does a really good job of capturing the news with interesting journalism. This was a little too casual and not very interesting.",3
awesome,04/12/2017,MM#11,awesome.,5
Great way to catch the big stories,04/12/2017,LateLifeRunnerGirl,"I love Morning Edition's in-depth coverage and fascinating stories, but this is a great way to ensure that I hear the top news when my time is limited -- which as a working mom, it often is. I often listen to this first and then go back to Morning Edition for whatever time I have left before heading out the door. Best of both worlds! I will say, it is at times a little jokier (is that a word?) or more lighthearted than I would have expected, given the stated intent of this podcast, but that is not a turnoff for me. Overall, I am happy to have it!",4
Too many ads and intro,04/12/2017,podcastlistener4800,This nine-minute podcast starts with a minute of intro/preamble then a full minute of ads! Two minutes of this before you get to content? I'm sticking with The Daily until you fix this mess.,2
Just Right,04/12/2017,apollosdescendant,The perfect bite size podcast with a cup of coffee in the morning. Thanks for keeping me up to date!,5
Lovely little podcast,04/12/2017,Jammin2u,A lot of info in a perfect amount of time for a short commute in the morning. Perfect! Thanks!,5
This and The Daily,04/12/2017,Jabberbrown,Listen to both podcasts when you have time. Listen to just NPR's when you don't.,5
Great,04/13/2017,diego898,But it's not The Daily,4
"Good, Not Great",04/13/2017,Woken and Wrathful,"There needs to be more breadth and less depth. This is a ten minute podcast, I don't need you to interview reporters to explain why the Syrian attack is important.",3
"Great idea, poor implementation",04/07/2017,JohnD2990,The concept of this podcast is great and the topics they choose are great... until you get to the last minute or two. Don't waste any time in a 10 minute podcast with stories about jay z and Beyonc√©. Otherwise I'm happy with it.,3
Just blah üòï,04/07/2017,Jaki-O,"Nothing more, nothing less. I'll try again in a month.. if it gets better I'll change my review.",2
Mission Accomplished!,04/07/2017,Am1994!!!1,"Up First has instantly become a mainstay of my morning commute. It gives a quick ~10 minute recap of the news in a really comprehensive way. It has replaced the NPR Hourly News Summary, which was nice but was always too short on each topic. Up First goes a little deeper than just the headlines but still keeps it short enough to squeeze into any commute. And it has all the great NPR staff from other shows like morning edition and NPR Politics.",5
"Love NPR, this needs work",04/07/2017,Cmgfrench,"Firstly, I love NPR and rely on it primarily as my news source. I also love the idea of a short podcast to start the day, as I don't rely of TV newscasts. I'm using this podcast as a quick news check-in, in case I'm unable to read the news during the day. I'd like it to stick to the most important news and not deliver pop culture related news. There are other podcasts for that. There are too many important things going on in the world to use valuable minutes of this short podcast for that. That said, I will continue to listen with the hope that it will find it's identity with time. Thanks!",3
Meh. More of the same.,04/07/2017,Jessie True,"How is this different than NPR news? The music tones: discordant doesn't match the mood. Nah, not subscribing.",3
Quick and Informative,04/07/2017,devondundee,I've been starting my days with Up First and find it very useful. I don't have to spend all day trying to catch up with the news because it's all covered in ten minutes first thing in the morning. Thanks for this great approach to news!,5
Perfect Daily Dose of NPR,04/07/2017,Se√±or Rios,Well executed implementation of exactly what attracts people like me to NPR.,5
"Quick, informative, entertaining",04/07/2017,Helgeb32,"People complaining about Beyonc√© being news are petty. She's the most followed celebrity right now, and frankly, people want to know about pop culture. I love that you get the big story right away with a little bit lighter hearted piece at the end. I will continue listening on my morning commute. I also love the short length. Keep it up.",5
No Thanks,04/07/2017,j footprint,"I was holding out hope that this would be a version of the hourly news summary, but as soon as I heard Inskeeps voice, I knew it was going to be a local nightly news type bantering charade. I already get plenty of NPR glib cutesy ebullience (Shapiro, Inskeep...), I'm darn well not going to subject myself to it through a podcast.",1
Easily digestable,04/08/2017,Bookshelves91,With the things going on the world it can be overwhelming so this podcast helps sum up the most important news. If there is any topic I'm interested in I can go to NPR.,5
Not really news,04/08/2017,Five Star Rating In Georgia,"This podcast should be simply titled ""NPR Political Podcast Lite"". All chatty political news, no hard US news. I get more and better US news off the BBC podcast daily. This podcast simply not worth my time.",1
Kill the theme music,04/08/2017,MGKL96,"It's a horror and makes this pointless show even less appealing. It's on par with the Zippah ads on CNN and I can't turn the radio off fast enough when it pops up in a promo. Anchors are good, though, and should be rescued and reassigned.",1
Staying informed,04/09/2017,ELFMEPLS,"I was listening to NYT's podcast, but I'm an devout NPR listener so I'm happy this came along! Definitely will be making the switch and listening to this in the morning. Also- to the people upset about them adding pop culture at the end of the episode, you've not listened to NPR very often then, they like to mix everything in to hopefully keep things balanced. Nothing wrong with that as long as Up First covers the politics segment accordingly!",5
Short and concise,04/09/2017,Matt_C29,Perfect for catching up on news with morning coffee or dog walk.,5
Give it time,04/09/2017,Bob K2,I'm not about to rate this program for at least a month. Any new venture takes time to learn and stabilize. I appreciate the effort by NPR.,5
Skimm-ish,04/10/2017,ToniAurilio,"For me, this is just the right amount of news with a touch of snark to make it easier to swallow. If you like to listen to your news and you prefer the people delivering the message aren't yelling at you, this is a darn good option.",4
Up First vs. The Daily: Discussion vs. Interview,04/10/2017,Razuls,"Up First and The Daily are very different podcasts.

Up First is a brief discussion of current headlines. They find their bytes then tailor the discussion around them.",5
Tone is off,04/10/2017,max wood,"The upbeat, cheesey music and hokey local TV news vibe are starkly at odds with the news they report on. Makes me feel weird. The Daily by the NYT is a much better, more thoughtful take on this concept.",2
Fantastic,04/10/2017,RowingFan75,Great synthesis of the day's key stories - with NPR's fantastic reporters and editors. A must-listen!,5
Waste of time,04/10/2017,Neil Wilson 64,"If I could get the podcast at 5:30 then it might have some value.
The podcast appears to be part of the first half hour of Morning Edition.",1
Just what I wanted!,04/05/2017,Chattanooga_amy,"Yes, I love it. I've been wanting a podcast like this to add to my daily lineup for a while. Excellent.",5
NPR is a national treasure,04/06/2017,Gavin Taylor,Great,5
Not Right for Podcast,04/06/2017,Kalebbn,"First things first - I love NPR!!! But podcasts are for telling stories - not providing 2 minute sound bites (even though I love Steve Inskeep's voice!). I love morning edition and turn it on occasionally in the morning. But podcasts are for telling stories and going deeper than just the surface. Don't listen to this podcast. If you want sound bite updates go to the NPR One app (love it!) and listen to the hourly updates. I'd happily change this rating if the podcast actually started doing a bit of in depth reporting - choose one topic to cover in the morning, not five. Anyways, hope this is constructive. Also, two advertisers for a 10 minute episode seems a bit much. Hope this constructive feedback is well received.",1
Great,04/06/2017,einah pets,"It's great to be able to take my favorite NPR hosts on my commute in the morning and get a rundown of the important stories of the day. The podcast is looser and more fun than listening on NPR. I already trust David Greene, Rachel Martin and Steve Inskeep, so a podcast with these folks is my idea of awesome. I loved the first episode and look forward to more!",5
Don't be fooled!,04/06/2017,Zidib,Don't be fooled! It's just another chat show! There's zero reporting. Not a news program I give it less than zero!,1
Thank you,04/06/2017,ggosy,Great to get a quick take first thing in morning!,5
cheap imitation of The Daily,04/06/2017,safiaansari,"This podcast is a half-baked mash up of NPR Politics Podcast and The Daily, without the research. Interviews were underwhelming. If you listen to NPR politics already, don't bother with this",2
Not the most important stories of the day,04/06/2017,Lillybell4,"The first 2/3 of this podcast are stellar - great contributors and relevant stories - then they talk about the new Golden Girls restaurant and the Beyonc√©. I love me some Bey, but with just 15 minutes, I need impactful information about the climate of the world around me.",3
Interested,04/06/2017,Silly Dot,I'm excited to see how this fleshes out as a series. Good luck guys I'll be listening regardless!,5

You can like both,04/06/2017,jburkitt,Everybody's acting like you can either listen to this or The Daily. Guys. You can listen to more than one podcast. Especially when both combined clock in at under 40 minutes.,4
Mr,04/06/2017,Jack277,Not up to NPR standards,1
The Daily is the Trump Report,04/06/2017,wisemandr73,"This is a great break from other daily podcasts that seem to just drone on and on about trump. I enjoy the spectrum of news and don't mind the small pop culture coverage. All the daily talks about is trump, there's other world news other than that clown. i'm sick of always just hearing about him.",5

"Daily Copycat, Far Cry From NPR Politcd",04/06/2017,@rarekeith,I was disappointed to listen to this new podcast and hear it was composed of the same people as NPR Politics. It tries to be like The Daily but hosts are not as thoughtful as Michael Barbaro.,1
David Green kills it again!,04/06/2017,ddickerson,"Now I can finally get a double dose of Mr. Green every morning! Up Now is a phenomenal replacement of the Morning Edition if you are short on time in the AM. In addition to being ""in-the-know"" on all current events, Up Now serves you a small platter of entertainment, pop-culture updates to keep you ""cool"" and relevant in the office. Bravo Maestro Green for continuing as America's go-to morning meditation.",5
Don't waste your time on this one.,04/06/2017,xzb781,Once you skip the banter and commercials it's about 5 minutes of trite opinion.,1

Solid morning coverage,04/07/2017,crookedsquare,Thanks to NPR for filling the gap between podcasts and existing coverage on the radio.,4
Been wanting something like this from NPR,04/05/2017,iPhone User One,"I've been wanting something like this from NPR, kind of an overall summary of what's going on, like The DailySkimm I get through email, but that I could listen to. This first episode is a start in the right direction, but not quite as much overall coverage as DailySkimm gives you. I hope they can integrate more, even if they have to increase the time to 15 minutes. And perhaps leave out useless information about the love lives pop stars and instead cover more real news about world events. Also, I've never seen a Podcast with a trailer in the actual episode list. That's normally something you'd incorporate into your broadcast, or maybe instead just include a quick snippet/intro in your first episode about what this podcast is all about. Keep it up guys! Looking forward to more.",5
shut off,04/05/2017,Oldaze,"The audio shuts off after 5 or so minutes, tried it twice. Is it my computer or ?

It's new but looking forward to this format and quick news.",5
Excellent News and Analysis,04/05/2017,JJ-575,The excellent news and analysis I would expect of the NPR Morning Edition Team. Easy 10 minutes to catch the important news of the day if you don't have time for a normal full on news program. Also a great way to get into listening to news if its not your thing.,5
NPR Up First,04/05/2017,First Chef,Great look at most important news of the day! Well presented and very informative.,5
Great! Love this,04/05/2017,rbarneydotcom,"Big fan of David. Great length. Actually listened to first episode, THEN reviewed. Keep up the great work guys",5
Morning Edition Lite,04/05/2017,srvoegtlin,"I like the idea behind this podcast, a bite size portion of Morning Edition.. but I was really unimpressed. I was expecting to hear stories that may not have made Morning Edition.. or perhaps more headlines..",3

NPR's Competitor to NYT's The Daily,04/05/2017,coldplaya3,Everyone's favorite show format with your even favorite-er hosts,5
Depends on preference.,04/05/2017,iRunCHI,I love NPR and the idea but Steve Inskeep is not my cup of tea. Way too far to the left for any chance of unbiased interviewing/reporting.,1
"Awful, it's a wannabe The Daily",04/05/2017,futurefriends,The music is annoying and they report the news like it's entertainment tonight or gossip - like syria's chemical warfare is an exciting teaser,1
Content,04/05/2017,Donnyxc,Pretty light but present a lot of information quickly. Not sure why others posted 1 stars... the actual content is solid.,5
I have great exptations,04/05/2017,Sallenicar,"I love NPR I have great expectations, thanks for the people who get up early to bring us this podcast. I get up at little bit later.",5
slightly misguided,04/05/2017,806051,"Believe me, I LOVE the hosts, but being chatty and morning show-y about chemical weapon use on children seemed a bit off, tone-wise. I'm sure they'll get it together, but for now, The Daily from NYT is a much better listen.",3
"Too much commentary, not enough news...",04/05/2017,Angus MacFrankenstein,"I was given the impression that this was going to be more of a tablet news show--essentially the head lines, but what I heard was more ""this politician should do this thing,"" more commentary than illumination.

Better off listening to hourly news summary,04/05/2017,Dshivers,"This seems like an attempt to compete with or complement the NY Times excellent podcast The Daily. It doesn't come anywhere close. It seems like the equivalent of chatty local TV news with some entertainment bits thrown in to finish off the show. If you want a quick summary of the day's news, you'd be better off using NPR One to lsiten to the 6 minute hourly news feed. Maybe it will get better with time. I hope so.",2
YES YES YES,04/05/2017,Layla Eller,I always miss Morning Edition on the radio and I am so happy that they finally made a podcast. I just wish it were longer!,5
Perfect first episode,04/05/2017,njoshy,Learned a lot and loved the length and pace. Looking forward to this every am.,5
Props,04/05/2017,teensyalmond,I'm concerned for the reporters who have to wake up for this (not sure it's the best use of time in an era when investigative journalism is more important than ever and journalistic resources are threatened) but I'm excited this model is finally being attempted!,5

This is a perfect idea.,04/05/2017,Truewu,I'm sure all of the one star reviews will get averaged out. I don't think people understand what teaser episodes are. I don't think I've encountered a podcast worth anything that didn't do one.,5
Great idea,04/05/2017,Sundeep Gupta,Thank you for this,5
Good One,04/05/2017,Kcanil08,Perfect dose of useless daily news. Short and detailed.,5

News for people on the go!,04/05/2017,Charlie Gabel,"The NPR team does a great job balancing depth of analysis and breadth of coverage. A valiant effort, successfully executed!",5
Great start to the day,04/05/2017,Brian Bosak,Great quality show. Love the concept but would like a more broad range of topics instead of so much depth on just a couple topics. Off to a great start. Brilliant idea for a show.,4
Stick to The Daily,04/05/2017,MissMar,"NPRs morning podcast is a poor substitution for NYTs' The Daily. The fact there was even an iota of time dedicated to Beyonc√© this morning is a far cry from the ""most important news"" I should know first thing in the morning. As a regular NPR listener, I am disappointed in the content and am sticking to Mike Barbaro at the NYT for relevant news.",1
Great news updates,04/05/2017,WreckEmTodd,"Very informative within a well-timed podcast. Only issue I have was the final segment, please leave unnecessary Hollywood news to local news stations.",4
"Strong Start, Very Disappointing Swing",04/05/2017,Breuninger4,"I was excited to try out a news podcast that would give me the bite size details of today's important stories. Podcast started strong, then took a swing to Beyonc√©/Jay-Z anniversary chatter. Why? Closing out the podcast discussing the ""Queen"" completely put a sour taste in my mouth. I'm a 25-year old looking to escape the constant bombardment of the Kardashians/People Magazines/etc. Apparently, this is not the place.",3
Missed opportunity,04/05/2017,CLN.NYC,"Ironic that NPR misses the chance to use this podcast to make something original to listen to; did they rush this out to compete w/ NYT's The Daily? Listen to The Daily, it creatively supplements interviews and adds depth to reported stories; the use of sound / music clips really works.",1
As Advertised...,04/05/2017,Keith Britt,"Caveat, this is a one episode review...

First the negatives... the theme music. It sounded like somebody smoked a lot of weed and tried to remix a porno soundtrack.",4
Glad to see this,04/05/2017,Jhorsfall,"I don't understand the 1 star reviews for the trailer..

Great first episode, pairs well my other new program on my morning drive",5
Great Morning News Brief,04/05/2017,Markka S.,A perfect selection of the most important news to start your day. An essential for news nerds and everyone else!,5
Perfect amount of news,04/05/2017,Thatdudewhowrtesreviews,This is the perfect thing to listen to in the morning just to get the broad sense of what's going on.,5
Excited but...,04/05/2017,MmyersGC,"This feels like an overlap of the NPR politics podcast. Happy to see NPR growing and I'll never complain about more content, but you can't knock the original team. Also, Beyonc√© story in the first show? Yes Sam Sanders we all miss you.",4
Thank you so much,04/04/2017,Boom360$,"I've been waiting for morning edition to have a podcast for years thank you for finally heeding the call, I love you so much üëçü§òüòò",5
One review...,04/04/2017,Brodie mcbrokerson,One 00:59 podcast. Charting No. 2 overall. Makes sense.,1

Great Source of Daily News,04/05/2017,The_pharmer,Great information from two great hosts,5
Ratings,04/05/2017,apt342,Giving you 5 stars since some people are rating you low because they think you couldn't possibly have a top 5 podcast with just a trailer. We have no idea how many people have listened to it. It's NPR. It's possible there are millions who listened to the trailer. I'm looking forward to the show! - 04/05/17,5
Platform Not Fixed,05/04/2019,SJH 2012,"I give up! I'm still getting Planet Money, which I never subscribed to. Not a great change NPR. I'll just go back to listening when I can in the car. I'm sorry, but I only want content I subscribe to & that it's doing this again after only a couple days is ridiculous. Test before you release a modification IT, especially if it didn't work before.",1
Decided that NPR is my choice for news,05/04/2019,WineTime MB,After many years of receiving news from all sources and in consideration of all the nonsense on social media I have decided that NPR is my go to source for news. I feel that they have the integrity and understanding of the responsibility that news gathering entails.,5
Back showing as planet money again,05/04/2019,gsarducci412,"You said you fixed this, this morning my up first went back to planet money, the politics podcasts disappeared. Come on NPR.",1
Each weekday am,05/04/2019,mberry99,"I start with Up First. Comforting, invigorating. I know that I can get out the door with a basic understanding of the news of the day. Thank you NPR!",5
