Live from Philly was Great,04/28/2019,Wilhomenah,I generally like this podcast. I‚Äôm so glad you all finally talked about the importance of women of color in this last episode. This topic needs to be talked about much more! Women of color are not only important because of their voting power. They will lead us out of this mess and we need to be listening to them!,4
Annoying happy joyful tone of reporting very serious stuff,04/28/2019,Seascorpio,"Annoying happy joyful tone of reporting very serious stuff. Constantly giggling at every comment.

Just Let It Go,04/23/2019,Storlietelling,"I used to relish listening to the NPR Politics and valued the in-depth analysis the show provided. But the podcast has deteriorated. Superficial coverage and constant giggling is getting old. On day of the Mueller Report release, they spent 1/3 of the time with Aesha Rasco leading a giggle fest on pop culture. Oxymoron for a politics podcast. I miss Scott Horsling. Fortunately there a many better politics podcasts.",1

Good - Would Be Better if Covered Both Sides,04/22/2019,Denny Royale,"Well thought out topics and intelligent positive hosts. I enjoy the content. I can only rate 3 stars for now because of one sided (left leaning) slant on topics. Please feel free to prove me wrong by at least considering the perspective that the 2020 Democratic presidency candidates are offering more and more giveaways in a transparent attempt to buy votes. Example: Warren student loan forgiveness - all you have to do is acknowledge the possibility. I listen to NPR in the hope I‚Äôll get both sides, please give it a try.",3

Beware!,04/01/2019,vtpod,"I love this podcast, BUT last week‚Äôs Update showed that even this podcast and the usually excellent Dominico Montanaro are just as susceptible as the rest of the media to Establishment brainwashing.

Undeclared Biden and Beto (seriously)?!? When reminded of Sanders, Montanaro musters a ‚Äòoh, yeah, right.‚Äô WHAT IS GOING ON?!? Since when do YOU get to determine reality rather than report on it?

Listen Liberal,04/16/2019,MedStudent11431,"Domenico Montanaro, NPR's lead political editor and host of this podcast has an obvious affinity for the Neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party which is in full view on this podcast.

It‚Äôs called the npr politics podcast, but it‚Äôs very evident that all of the hosts are more left leaning. That‚Äôs okay, but then just call the pod something more appropriate like the npr politics podcast, left leaning edition (rolls off the tongue). Or feature more input from people who have differing opinions. But it feels disingenuous to call it a general politics pod but then come at every story from one perspective.",3
Pulling the plug!,04/20/2019,long time listener.,Been listening to this show since day one but finally had to pull the plug on it. Just another group of left leaning reporters miss informed and giving bias opinions and half truths.,1
Unbiased Political Coverage with Lovable Hosts,02/05/2019,Alicia Magee,"Where does NPR get all these wonderful people?

BIASED BIASED BIASED!!!,02/06/2019,Joe Sturza,"This is the most biased group of ""journalists"" I have ever listened too. It is blatantly obvious that they have nothing good at all to say about President Trump and his administration. I personally am a Trump fan, but there are both things I like and don't like about him; just as there are things I like and don't like about his opposition. I am not by any means a journalist and don't get upset easily, but this is absolutely ridiculous. I subscribed to this podcast to obtain unbiased political news and updates, but all I am getting is the much UNWANTED OPINIONS of a group of salty Trump opposers. To say that Trump even hinted (in his State of the Union speech on 2/5/2019) towards having the opinion that immigration is bad for or hurting this country is such a flat out lie. These people obviously can't distinguish the difference between the terms ‚ÄúILLEGAL immigration‚Äù and ‚ÄúLEGAL immigration‚Äù. He specifically stated (not in so many words, but) that he is very supportive of LEGAL immigration, and that he is very much so (obviously) against ILLEGAL immigration. Not once did touch on his opinion towards immigration, because Trump (like the rest of us that don't have our heads up our you know whats, or like those that can actually put there salty feeling towards Trump aside [you know the sore-loser feelings because they lost the election] and recognize/do what is right for the country) can actually distinguish the difference between ILLEGAL and LEGAL immigration. That is just one example, but this group of ‚Äújournalists‚Äù is exactly what is wrong with journalism, and why Americans like myself are losing faith in journalism.",1
It‚Äôs politics! For kids!!!,02/11/2019,Espnfsbysdth,"I really do want to like this show. I have been a listener since mid 2016, but they are doing a disservice to their listeners. There is an active refusal by the hosts to ever state a fact portraying republicans in a negative light without also saying something negative about democrats. It is the ignorance of a group of people who are clearly unaffected by politics and see it more as a hobby to be laughed about than something serious. Sometimes there truly is a right and a wrong but you won‚Äôt learn about it here.",1

Biased towards the Gates Foundation Interests,03/11/2019,Nina8625,"The Gates Foundation‚Äôs highly strategic moves in philanthropy can be seen in NPR‚Äôs coverage of the upcoming primary coverage. The last live episode, in Atlanta, gave Bernie Sanders little to no coverages of all democratic presidential contenders. NPR lost my support and subscription.

Critical thinking?,03/15/2019,Optimist runner,Insightful commentry on political news. Would be more insightful if it a bit less of a liberal lean. And the informal style gets tiresome sometimes: stick to the topics.,3
Ageist views,03/20/2019,Shelmel,"I‚Äôve been listening to NPR Politics podcast for years. I‚Äôve been surprised by the journalists open biases before, but this week broke my formerly positive opinion of them into pieces. When speaking about the clear Dem front runner so far, Bernie Sanders, they have literally chuckled, scoffed and belittled their way through every coverage of him. It is maddening. I‚Äôm no blind follower if Bernie, I just want to hear his views like everyone else‚Äôs. They literally asked him WHY he needs to run at all, when his policies have already made it onto the Democratic agenda. Well, why on earth shouldn‚Äôt he run, if he was so successful at getting good ideas out there? If Bernie‚Äôs an idiot, why would Warren, Harris, Booker and a plethora of other candidates adopt his views? (And where in the world is the coverage of Andrew Yang?) NPR is really showing their pro-war, pro-corporation bias here. Stop telling us who COULD or COULDN‚ÄôT win. You screwed that up last election. Just let us decide by hearing the candidates voices, with the SAME fairly posed questions for each candidate. Sheesh.",2
Men over women,03/21/2019,bagkey,"Sometimes the male reporters talk over the females, finishing their sentences, not letting them finish...interrupting to add in. It‚Äôs annoying and they shouldn‚Äôt do it. Very disrespectful. just saying... but I love the podcast",5

"Personality-driven, very informal ""news-lite""",12/31/2018,Mauimike6,"This is a very informal personality-driven ""news chat"" podcast wherein four or five NPR correspondents meet several times a week to offer up their personal takes on a few high-visibility news items and political issues that dominate the current news cycle. No in-depth analyses here, just quick, off-the-cuff observations about inside-the-Beltway ""hot topics."" Although the format bears some resemblance to a formal round-robin-style discussion overseen by a moderator, the reality has more of a ""newsies gathering at the office cooler"" feel to it: lots of ""me-first"" interruptions, inside joking, and everybody talking at once. On the rare occasion when a more senior correspondent joins the group, or if that day's news cycle includes a lot of ""serious"" topics, actual in-depth analysis and serious discussion may occur. This podcast's ""unscripted content"" is not on the level of PBS's Shields and Brooks podcast. It appeals more to regular NPR listeners who enjoy hearing what their favorite correspondents are like without a script... or adult supervision.",2
Great place to get clued in,01/03/2019,Sra84,"I love this show, the format, the hosts and the information it provides. It‚Äôs not the deepest dive, and sometimes i wish there were more context given, but there are other podcasts for that. For an enjoyable recap of whatever‚Äôs happening, this is my first stop.",5
So biased and amateurish,01/03/2019,Koochiboo,"Bias just drips out of the participants‚Äô mouths with no apparent attempt to conceal it. Most of the podcast people sound like they just got out of high school and thus, do not sound credible. Mara Liason (spelling?) is listenable because of her long experience, but her bias is quite obvious. Please try to present a more balanced discussion. Lose the millennial types. They contribute nothing.",1
"Not objective, too casual",01/03/2019,Jodeshab,"When the reporters are so casual it makes them sound more like cable news hosts. Also, to me, political editor Dominick Montenegro sounds happy when good things happen to democrats and resentful when good things happen to republicans.",1
My Go To Politics Podcast,01/03/2019,EWangsmo,I started listening during the craziness of the 2016 presidential election and have been a loyal listener since then. I enjoy the more informal tone of the podcast (but I also like their radio stories).,5
Garbage,01/08/2019,latinmemina,Hate speech,1
Shameful bias,01/09/2019,Robert Tilling,I am a life long listener of NPR and liberal Democrat. The coverage has fully crossed the line into inaccurate liberal Trump-bashing bias. I am so sick and tired of hearing them grasp for ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù arguments at the expense of talking about actual issues. It is shameful that public money is used to produce this drivel. You are journalists for gods sake act like it. Have some self respect. I don‚Äôt care what your opinion is. Tell me the news. I am so sad that NPR has turned into full-on unapologetic fake news.

Going down since the election,01/15/2019,Klaus Van Winkle,Originally came to the podcast to hear in-depth reporting on the election. I found the historical comparisons and knowledge of the contributors reassuring during a crazy news cycle. But recently the podcast has become more jokey and lighthearted.

Casual discussion style with substance,01/29/2019,nursenanrn,"Great summary of the weekly events in ‚Äúthe weekly round up‚Äù and shorter podcasts when something new pops up (which is sometimes daily) to keep you informed. Love the casual discussion style, the panel presents you with both sides of an argument (although the hosts don‚Äôt hide their personal views) and I love that the intro every week is different and taken from callers!

Tamara Keith Makes the Show!!!,01/30/2019,Wild Olive Shoot,"NPR is no longer your father‚Äôs Oldsmobile! Tamara leads intelligent, accurate, balanced, and fresh reporting in a fun and amusing fashion. Her innocent sweet charm comforts her fans like a big sister.

Great for Left Leaning view of political events,11/27/2018,Pdaddy1569,I enjoy listening to NPR politics podcast as a part of my portfolio of news and political punditry sources. The show is well produced and easy to follow. The podcasters provide a good breakdown of events and even some basic politics 101 info.,4
Stop using the republican talking points,11/27/2018,Intelligentsia,"The conversation about politics is well thought out in most circumstances but because you use the republican talking points to start the conversation and don‚Äôt refute them you are contributing to the problem. For example, Your discussion about the republicans keeping the senate failed to mention that the democrats got 16,000,000 more votes than the republicans did. This is important to point out for the same reason that people who look at a red map and interpret that to mean the republicans significantly outnumber democrats is wrong. Land doesn‚Äôt vote. People do. All of that red has fewer people in it than California. Use a cartogram that shows population based results.",1

"I love this show, I am not a fan of Tamara Keith",12/10/2018,Lessers793,"I love this show and look forward to every podcast that comes out. I was listening to this podcast when it was just the two men talking; Ron and I think Ken. I love it when Ron is on the air, he seems to know everything about anything politics or otherwise. I have to say, and I am so sorry, I am not a huge fan of Tamara Keith. I like everyone else and all the hosts seem to get along and have a cute and fun banter that makes the podcast literally fly by in what feels like seconds. Unfortunately, Tamara comes off as a know it all and frequently interrupts the other hosts with her thoughts and I really don‚Äôt think what she adds is very interesting or useful.

While the reporters/hosts change rather often, the quality of their reporting does not. I love how creative their ‚Äúcan‚Äôt let it go‚Äù segments get.

Analytical and Informative,12/14/2018,thundershower,"I'm sure I'm not the first to say it, but this is a great podcast.

A wide range of political coverage,12/19/2018,Best of Kirt,I‚Äôm disheartened to see so many reviews mourning the loss of ‚Äúserious journalism‚Äù at the top of the iTunes page for this podcast. It seems as though many of them reviewed a single episode instead of the podcast as a whole. I‚Äôve listened to every episode of NPR Politics since its inception. Some episodes are more lighthearted and fun. Others are more focused on the developing stories taking place at the time. All include welcome and measured insight into the context for the news. A rotating panel of hosts and contributors offer varying viewpoints. And each of them does their best to make sure the information being shared is accessible. Anyone who bemoans this approach as ‚Äúdumbing things down‚Äù is discounting the importance of welcoming new and young ears to the NPR listener audience. This is a smart and entertaining review of political news that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.,5
Good for staying up to date on happenings,12/21/2018,derek.craig6,"I like being informed about the topics brought up on the show, but I‚Äôm not a huge fan that most co-hosts seem to favor one political party. Holding an unbiased opinion on this podcast surely has to be difficult, but at least have a balanced group of co-hosts.

Meh,10/19/2018,Evertoseer,"A good starter podcast for the politically uninitiated, but a strong establishment bias. While they acknowledge the division of the country, they don‚Äôt dive deep and explore the frustration people now have with establishment candidates. They overwhelmingly write off progressive candidates despite the fact that those platforms are becoming increasingly popular, particularly with millennials. The fact that some of these races are so close deserves closer analysis rather than insisting those new candidates cannot win. Same can be said for more right wing new candidates who are popular in some areas.",3

Most of the cast sounds young, so maybe that is they rely on statistics instead of experience or intuition, but this podcast operates under the assumption that ALL OF AMERICA is either a democrat or a republican. They almost never mention independent voters, and when they do they assume there aren‚Äôt enough of us to make a difference. Aside from Mara, I don‚Äôt have respect for any of them.",3
Love it!,11/01/2018,larzie314,"I love this podcast. I think Tam does a great job of hosting, and I also like Domenico and Ron Elving.

The lack of fact checking borders on journalistic malpractice,11/02/2018,DRiveraG,"After being a devote listener for almost 3 years (since the podcast started), today I sadly unsubscribed. The lack of fact checking of claims made by politicians on both sides of the isle in this podcast is serious malpractice.

11/1 racist wrap up,11/02/2018,moonbeam ranch,I was really disturbed by the arrogant and racists commentary.

"Ok content, heavy bias",11/02/2018,Lem Kenada,"Definitely leans center left. This pod is ok but lacking in genuinely interesting perspectives.

Not exactly NPR's best.,11/04/2018,Oddballgamee,"I gave a couple of these a try and it doesn't feel like the thoughtful, objective, and analytical coverage that say ""On Point"" does. This show seems more like an opinionated round table for novice journals.",1

NPR - Never Promote Republican?,11/06/2018,weeper123,"I started listening to this podcast during the presidential debates and really appreciated the information about all the candidates and the politics surrounding them. However, as the pod has progressed and, of course, Trump has become the president, the negativity toward the ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù or ‚Äúconservative‚Äù has just become too much. Instead of just reporting, it has become a backhanded way of bashing what you, as reporters do not support.

Falls flat on sharing any relevant and new information.,11/07/2018,CFE Follower,"I actually initially gave this podcast 5 stars after listening to the first episode. My second episode was the midterm recap and man did it fall flat. It was an absolute waste of my time. The analysis could have been given by someone who caught just a few minutes of the morning news before breaking it down. There were relatively no surprises in the midterms. They were just what we thought, republicans pick up seats in the senate, democrats take control of the house but to hear their analysis you would think that the results were mind blowing for democrats.

So extremely biased,09/11/2018,k8eannh,"I could literally only listen to about 4 minutes of this podcast. I like to hear liberal arguments because I like to be open minded but this podcast is ridiculous. They actually say ridiculous things. In the Bret Kavanaugh day 2 episode one of the women was commenting about how Kavanaugh came off as very serious and not cuddly or lovable. Who cares about thst? Shouldn‚Äôt we want the highest court in the land to be serious and to take the law seriously? Remember the last time the country went for cuddly and lovable? We ended up with Obama which then gave us Obamacare, a failing economy, crossed red lines with Syria, and an American apology tour. This podcast is pretty dumb.",1

High school politics,08/03/2018,RobertoStorio,"This podcast is like a bunch of highschoolers talking about politics - constant giggling and laughing... Aside from politics they really know little.

If this is the level of NPR reporters then there's no point listening to NPR. There are a few adults who are on regularly (won't mention names), but aside from that the commentary is very often banal and inane. And then to show they're even handed there's always, ""well, to be fair, other presidents also..."" Today in talking about conspiracy theories they resorted to this tactic as if there is an equivalency between the past and the type of conspiracy theorizing coming from the White House itself - with a president who promised Alex Jones that he would be proud of him!

What happened???,05/11/2018,Ma Joad,This week‚Äôs show was almost unlistenable. Banter thin and watery and too much Trump kissing up. Missing the regulars.,5
Look forward to every episode,05/12/2018,Mae Rodgers,"I started listening to the NPR Politics crew before the presidential election. They were my port in the storm, they helped explain the insanity. They continue to do so and I never miss an episode.",5
Embarrassingly Pro Government,05/17/2018,mrjohnson6969,"This podcast is essentially a mouthpiece for government institutions.
Listen to their episode about the one year anniversary of the Mueller investigation. It‚Äôs cringe worthy to hear how much these ‚Äúreporters‚Äù fawn over the deep state.",1
I‚Äôm done with this podcast,05/17/2018,tr..........,Mara Liasson is totally unable to admit to the lies and hypocrisy of the current administration and the republican congress. I was unaware that she is also a Fox contributor but now that I know her obvious biases now make sense.,1
"Subscribe to many, but don‚Äôt miss this one.",05/19/2018,"Merrihew, J","Full of accurate confident reporting, and always produces quality content.",5
"Lovely, efficient way of learning what's up",05/19/2018,NikitaChikita,"Love this podcast! I listen to every episode (still very understandable on 1.5 speed, for those of you with many other podcasts to listen to). Very succinct analyses and updates on current political situations, and remains entertaining because of the sweet banter and personalities. Cannot say enough great things, would highly recommend to someone who wants to become more politically engaged and aware, but is intimidated regarding where to begin.",5
A must listen each week,05/19/2018,ediggitynodoubt,"NPR has become a go-to for me - each week‚Äôs episode is a comprehensive, no bull recap with explanation of both sides of the top stories. Always provides context so I never feel lost no matter how much I‚Äôve kept up with the news each week.",5
This podcast has become a joke.,05/22/2018,Stooby21,For supposedly smart people they sound like idiots.,1
Compromised,05/23/2018,Kccb68,The pure dismissive disrespect for progressive candidates is blatant at NPR. This lets me know where their money comes from. Bernie is the most popular candidate in the United States right now according to all polls but you will never know that by listening to NPR.,2
Get Rid of the Listener Intros,05/24/2018,socialworktech,"Hi there, first time, long time...

Seriously, no one gives a flying F about these people. It makes me want to unsubscribe. It‚Äôs stupid. I really, really, hate it. It ruins the rest of this intelligent, quirky, well-thought-out show. These people aren‚Äôt interesting or special and I don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre ex-pats voting abroad from khanahar.",1
One of my favorites,05/24/2018,Knapdx,This has become one of my favorite podcasts. It‚Äôs a great way to get more detailed news analysis in a less formal but still thoughtful way.,5

Good show to help you stay up to date!,05/31/2018,PS4031,"Not as good as it once was, but still worth listening to in order to stay up to date in politics. The cast just seems a little more out of touch these days, but maybe that‚Äôs just the 2016 election effect",4
What I can‚Äôt let go,06/01/2018,Tayyyyyuuuuuuuuuu,"The way Ayesha pronounces Can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not Cain‚Äôt, it‚Äôs Can‚Äôt. Her pronunciation of words is really annoying and like nails to a chalk board.",3
More Mara! More Ayesha!,04/20/2018,amedit,I never miss an episode! I always wish there was MORE MARA and I also can't wait to hear more from the new contributor Ayesha Rascoe. Yay Mara and Ayesha!,5
Read Koreans mind correctly.. please,04/20/2018,Hayangae,"First, never put Koreans and Japanese in the same bin. What Abe Shinjo wants is not same as Korean‚Äôs. He has been taking advantage of Bad relationship between The two Koreas. And what Koreans really want is settling peace permanently by making peace treaty between NK and US, and Completely end Korean war. Koreans are different from Japanese. Are you going to be happy Americans are same as Rusians because of skin color?",3
Great overview of the news that matters most,04/20/2018,alc0f7,"I expected to stop listening to this podcast after the November 2016 election, but 2 years later it's still required listening! The insight and analysis really can't be beat.",5
Those intros...,04/20/2018,dethfromabove1,Hey NPR Politics team. I just want you to know at least one of your listeners finds your fan-submitted intros the most unbearably cringy garbage they‚Äôve ever heard. I wish you made them more generic or just discontinued them altogether.,1
The most even-keeled take on politics,04/20/2018,Disgruntled.,I love this politics for how it represent multiple views in its reporting. I can't help but listen to the updates as they post. I only wish they released more shows.,5
My Favorite Podcast,04/21/2018,unabletochoosenickname,"The NPR Politics Podcast is my absolute favorite.

I enjoy the interaction of the panelists and appreciate their intelligence, experience, integrity, and dedication to journalism.",5
Reality TV? Soap opera digest? Nope. Politics,04/24/2018,Juliejuliejulie1979,It is informative and keeps me up to date on the constant changes happening in the government. I appreciate when they explain things I‚Äôm not familiar with and translate all the confusing lexicon of politics (i.e tax law). I listen to it on the way to work. The ‚Äúcan‚Äôt let it go‚Äù segment is the perfect way to end these depressing and heavy issues. Great job!! I donated to my local NPR bc I loved this show (and UpFirst) so much! Thanks!!,5
The best!,04/25/2018,Moniponi,"The NPR Politics Podcast is my most favorite of all the podcasts I listen to, political or otherwise! üòâ The journalists are insightful, funny, and have genuine relationships with each other that are apparent in their questions and answers.

Does not disappoint,04/27/2018,Jkballentine,I must admit I was a little cautious about this show at first. I was concerned it wouldn‚Äôt be balanced. My fears were unfounded and I love the show and the people on it. I find myself hoping something crazy breaks out and they are forced to do an episode. Fortunately the current political environment has not disappointed me ! Keep up the good work.,5
Nice Politics Discussion,04/27/2018,Sooooooooo...,"Reminds me a bit of Slate's gabfest, but it feels like these folks are deep into a reputable & dependable news source. Conservatives might be annoyed that their view isn't super well represented here.",5

the best politics podcast or just the best podcast?,04/30/2018,danimal6868,"The only thing wrong with the NPR Politics Podcast is that there isn't a new episode every day of the week!

Thanks, you guys, for ruling so hard!",5
"Longtime listener, makes political deluge bearable",05/01/2018,lindsayraemyers,"I've been listening to this pod almost since the very beginning and even when everything going on feels like drinking from a firehouse the NPR team makes it digestible and entertaining... even fun. I can bearly listen to the main NPR news mags because it just feels like the political coverage is relentless. On the politics pod it feels like a refreshing quick workout as compared to a slogging marathon. I think the hosts are great and, like any good podcast, you feel like you get to know them after a while (congrats on the multiple pod babies, guys!) and the episodes feel like very informative catch ups. :)",5

A weekly MUST,05/05/2018,HMMOM11,"Can't live without this show. It's funny, but a really good source of updated news. Only downside is that they don't tape every day (or hour)",5
check out In The Thick instead,05/05/2018,unsustainedcommunion,"I‚Äôd been listening to this podcast for a while. How glib they were about important issues rubbed me the wrong way. After the episode covering the Correspondents Dinner I decided to delete it. I finally accepted that I need my politics coverage with more perspective. I highly recommend In The Thick with national treasure Maria Hinojosa instead. ITT covers real issues in an honest way. Unlike the Politics Podcast, ITT can be light and joke about issues while also handling those issues thoughtfully and seriously.",1
Always a great review of the past few days and great insight,04/02/2018,JRod062203,"I appreciate the honest, experiences, and realistic reporting on commentary in this podcast.",5

"Essential, Remarkable, Fun",04/05/2018,DylanWolfe,"For me, listening to the NPR Politics Podcast is like being specially invited in to their newsroom, to listen to a guided in-depth discussion on breaking news events, as told by veteran news reporters and political junkies, providing a blend of inside information, shaded nuance, bubbly humor, and sharp-edged wisdom. Most remarkable of all, they pack all of it into a format that makes it seem like if the Politics Podcast didn‚Äôt exist, they‚Äôd all meet in the break room to discuss the same exact things for fun, over some pizza and sodas. I just love it to death, and you will to.",5
Great rundown of the week,04/07/2018,AmyC,Everyone at the NPR politics podcast is terrific. Thanks for putting together such an interesting and informative show every few days guys!,5
Love it,04/11/2018,Cockinstine,Love this podcast. Always informative and always relevant,5
A great and nuanced politics podcast,04/11/2018,minkone,"The people behind this podcast really care and it shows. They are knee deep in the nuances and they're enthusiastic about sharing and demystifying the current news, reading way beyond the headlines or 'message'. I don't think (unlike another review) they are trying to be hip. Their wonkiness and enthusiasm is too hard to hide. Super in-depth podcast. Does what it says on the tin.",5
A Consistently Great podcast,04/12/2018,Jessjaynick,"I recently started listening and now find myself wishing this was a daily podcast! Always informative, great insight and perspective, knowledgeable hosts and guests - all around awesome!",5
"Charming, Informative, and Fun",04/12/2018,A. Theo Judd,"It‚Äôs impossible to do a politics podcast without bias so don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find that here. What you will find are some interesting pieces of information about what‚Äôs happening in American politics right now. They timestamp every podcast so you know how relevant the information is, and they try to present opposing viewpoints if the panelists don‚Äôt agree with it. It‚Äôs as good as you can get in terms of ‚Äúfairness.‚Äù What‚Äôs truly wonderful about the show is that the hosts are the type of people you‚Äôd like to sit down and have coffee (or a cocktail) with and just shoot the breeze. They bring forth ideas and theories that are researched and well-developed even if they aren‚Äôt perfect. And best of all, they don‚Äôt take themselves too seriously. This is one of NPR‚Äôs best podcasts, second only to The 1A in my opinion.",5
Nice Mix of Reporters,04/12/2018,WEGreensox,Concise and informative.,5
Wish it was less biased,04/12/2018,Meggin1,I love love love NPR but find the tone of this podcast very obviously left of center....which is exactly where my political views lie. I‚Äôd love to hear a more balanced approach as I seek to understand where others are coming from.,4

Excellent Podcast,04/20/2018,TB2033,"Truly excellent news podcast. I especially like the weekly round up. The correspondents are knowledgeable and engaging. I particularly like the discussions that involve veteran journalists like Ron Elving or Mara Liasson with younger journalists that turn out to be history lessons as well as news commentary. The regular group of contributors engages well with each other, asking questions that are very pertinent. I listen regularly to this podcast, the New Yorker Politics and More and the Wall Street Journal Potomac Watch. All are very good with each having a point of view. Listening to different source with different viewpoints is really how to get news that is ‚Äúfair and balanced‚Äù.",5
The Best Politics podcast!,04/20/2018,Daphdaniel,"This podcast is awesome. Fair, balanced, and entertaining is exactly what I wanted in a politics podcast. I found it with NPR Politics Podcast. The knowledgeable hosts are passionate and don't sensationalize stories. Sam's pop culture references always make me laugh or groan (not another Kanye quote lol). I really appreciate that their experts are genuine experts and not random contributors like on TV (looking at you Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù. I also appreciate that their oldest host (I don't remember his name because in my mind I call him ""camplopedia""‚Äîthe campaign encyclopedia"") has actually lived through the past campaigns and political events they discuss.",5

One of my favorite politics podcasts,03/13/2018,DopeSuburbanMama,They keep me up-to-date with regular podcast releases and help explain how a new event in politics fits in with everything else going on.

This podcast saves me,03/14/2018,mandylion6,"In a time of ubiquitous stressful news, the NPR politics podcast saves the day.

Great listen,03/14/2018,ET_FROM_MARS,Great political podcast featuring a diverse and rotating cast of NPR political journalists. Entertaining and informative,5

Good show,03/15/2018,Psychoduk,"It‚Äôs a podcast. It‚Äôs entertaining, informative and free. If that somehow inspires a fear in any listener that the collapse of modern society is imminent, or this is a cog into some indoctrination conspiracy machine...I‚Äôm kind of envious of that.

Waste of time low information NPR Stereotypes,03/18/2018,Silence B.F. Dogood,"I should have turned it off when they scoffed at Nina Totenberg for being to ""into the Supreme Court."" I have tolerated the giggly BS chatter of the hipster idiots from NPR. But, when Tamara Kieth she had never heard of the Whiskey Rebellion it is time to unsubscribe and delete it from my feed. Perhaps a few years ago this might have seemed like an event obscured in early American history. In the wake of the 2010 quote of the year, (""keep the governemnt out of my medicare"") and election results where voters oppose governemnt taxes and government intervention but worship the high cost military and complain about lack of government services, this is an essential dynamic to understanding the United States poltical dynamic in the 21st Century. Tamara Kieth ignorance cannot be giggled thorugh by the superficial fashion kids at NPR, it is a disqualifying admisiosn and a firing offense. For my, the actions I can take are to delet the podcast and never donate to anything at that might provide funding for celebrating such ignorance.",1

A Godsend of Non-Biased Reporting,02/12/2018,Tenshi_Sasher,"I started listening to NPR Politics Podcast because I had read that of all major media outlets, NPR has the highest journalistic integrity when it comes to non-partisan and biased reporting. As much as I love Pod Save America and other progressive media outlets, I found myself really longing to make sure that I wasn't feeding myself a steady diet of outrage and emotionalism in a time when citizens desperately need to understand what's going on in a holistic, informed manner. In that sense, the NPR Politics Podcast has been a godsend for me.",5
Grand Jury on Russia Podcast,02/17/2018,batjay,"I love your podcast but the episode about the Grand Jury on Russia that you posted yesterday was a bit off - your three podcasters sounded too giddy talking about how Russia attacked the country, enjoying talking about it way too much.",1
Journalists as sensemakers,02/18/2018,PixKris,"I love this podcast because I trust everyone one it; they have years of experience for their beats and build off each other to come to an understanding about difficult topics.

Informed perspective twice-weekly,01/26/2018,Kojitator,"For me, a required listen every week, or twice a week. Especially these days, there is a lot happening and even more being said that may or not have basis in truth. NPR Politics offers perspective from journalists on the front line of American politics that separates what matters from what distracts, analyses the who and why of the issues of the day, and clarifies what it means for America and Americans.",5
One of the best political podcasts,01/26/2018,Kernzen,Love all the commentators. Very educational and made me love politics.,5
Best unbiased look at US politics,01/27/2018,johngiac,I have been listening to this podcast since the 2016 election and I find it incredibly informative and insightful.

Respectable effort,01/31/2018,CorkyWeliver,"Listen and enjoy regularly... attempting to balance with other commentary political podcasts. For the most part, the NPR panel attempts to present both liberal and what they believe to be the conservative perspective... after all it is NPR. I respect that effort.",5
Out-dated,01/31/2018,Kris Armitage,"In their attempt to be objective, they manage to say...nothing. They don‚Äôt call out Trump for the abomination that he is. They just sit there and miss the story that national norms are being toppled. They just don‚Äôt understand politics. As a lifelong Washingtonian and NPR listener since the early ‚Äò80‚Äôs, it‚Äôs kinda sad. NPR always got it. Now they‚Äôre kinda clueless to the travesty that is DC politics and who‚Äôs doing what. Oh well.",2

Great political news,02/04/2018,justjayce,"Love this podcast! It‚Äôs a great way to stay informed. They tend to focus more on news and political strategy instead of opinions, which I happen to prefer. That being said, there is an vague center left bias but it‚Äôs rather minor and most of the time they stick to fact, history, and polling, etc. I‚Äôve become avid fans of Tamara Keith, Scott Detrow, and Ron Elving since I started listening a year ago and I love the rotating cast of reporters they have come in every week. The highlight is always their ‚Äúcan‚Äôt let it go‚Äù segment where they lighten the mood and talk off topic for a little bit. It serves as a well needed palette cleanser and is always my favorite segment of the week! Love these guys!",5
Dedicated Listener,02/06/2018,Uterose,Love this podcast. Great group of reporters providing insights into a political world that I better understand now. Thanks for all the hard work and quality content!,5
Dumbed down for the Age of Trump,02/06/2018,Satomoug,"If this podcast is aimed at a fifth-grade audience, it‚Äôs very good. But if the intended audience is the inquisitive adult, it leaves a great deal to be desired. The analyses rarely do more than scratch the surface of any subject and with the exception of Mara Liasson, the hosts seem to care more about the impact of what they are saying rather than the substance.",2
Wow,02/07/2018,Rikdizzle,"I feel dumber for listening to these guys regularly!!! I want to give them a chance, and listen to what they‚Äôre saying, but their obvious bias is totally ridiculous and btw, I have no preference for the current potus, wow is all I have",1
Best Political Podcast!,02/08/2018,Anit,I want to thank you for making my morning gym routine more enjoy. Informative and entertaining at the same time. Keep up the good work:),5
Helps me understand politics,02/08/2018,ciaradawn,I like the informal banter and conversational manner of this podcast. They help me understand politics better. And I can count on them to update me on the important stuff for the most part. NPR falls on the liberal side but I can look past that for this podcast. They do a pretty good job of remaining neutral overall.,4
Still too much on the horse race aspect of politics,02/09/2018,Connie RR,"A good show but still too much on the horse race aspect of races. Who's up who's down.

Vile cowardice in the face of a new gilded age,12/22/2017,Andrew Stine,"Utterly disgusting and insipid. Your nauseating devotion to bloodlessly discussing ""winners and losers"" and transparently cynical both-sides-ism is utterly insane at a time when one party is nakedly looting and immiserating the country. But I'm sure your corporate sponsors are happy with your cowardly, anodyne blathering, so good job I guess.",1
New Years Resolution: Leave Podcast Reviews,12/29/2017,Khglynn,New Years Resolution: finally leave reviews for at least your top 50 podcasts. They give you way too much free entertainment. The least you can do is leave them a quick review.,5
Good intelligent reporting,12/30/2017,slebresh,I‚Äôve always enjoyed NPR‚Äôs method of reporting the news. It‚Äôs fact based and I don‚Äôt have to worry about hearing useless bickering between the host. I look forward to this feed in my podcast.,5
Great show,12/30/2017,Bossoccer84,Great expertise and concomitant insight on our government and the politics behind it. Keep up the great work in 2018.,5
Great source of REAL information!,12/30/2017,RachienNJ,"Great job of givign historical background to the events that are happening hourly (it seems) but not delving to deeply into the opinion talking-head aspect of many podcasts and ""news"" shows. Fun to listen to and very informative in a short amount of time. I greatly look forward to this show twice a week.",5
Blather,01/04/2018,badfaith33,"I didn‚Äôt find this podcast to be very informative or enlightening. They remind me of the talking heads that can be found on any television news show. On most days, they can spent 30-45 minutes jabbering about ideas that have already been thoroughly dissected in other news sources, including NPR itself. There is also an annoying attempt to appear ‚Äúnonpartison‚Äù, without analyzing, validating or critiquing the truth claims espoused by politicians. For example, some thorough analysis of the tax overhaul and it‚Äôs growth (jobs/gdp/debt) assumptions would have been nice; or a repeated critique of the 2017 healthcare reform (that never seemed to have anything to do with healthcare reform) might have displayed some journalistic excellence; or if they‚Äôre going to treat and reread the president‚Äôs tweets as official white house communication, some validation of the truthfulness of the statements might be journalistically responsible. If I‚Äôm doubting the significance of the content of a podcast, then I suppose I should be listening to something else. They had nothing meaningful to discuss in the first week of 2018, so most of the first podcast was spent talking about the consequence of the future November election and possible legislative agendas for 2018. It was an absolute waste of 30 minutes of my life. I‚Äôve been wanting to unsubscribe from this podcast for much of 2017, but it was such an important year that I just kept hoping the podcast might improve.",1
Thanks but...,01/05/2018,Sherryist,"For the most part you all seem nonpartisan, but I‚Äôve never heard people more jovial about the sudden possibility of nuclear war. Scott Detrow, you were so passionate about the congresswomen who went up against Kelly but I‚Äôve never seen you follow up with a response to what really happen. Nor have I ever heard you all say anything about the unprecedented manner in which DT runs the country. I‚Äôm not saying be partisan, I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre contributing to the normalization of this behavior by acting like it‚Äôs completely normal that the president just sent a retaliatory treat to a hostile nation holding nuclear arms. Try to act like this is a big deal for once. You‚Äôre no better than WP so stop acting like it.",2
Best One Out There,01/06/2018,sophers1,"Have listened to nearly every episode of this podcast for about two years, it always brightens my week and has inspired me to pursue politics in the future! Love the hosts, love the show, and love when they talk about the minnesota twins!!",5

Love it!,01/13/2018,meaganjanel,The podcast seems unbiased to me (as much as is possible in this day and age) and usually if there is a viewpoint given there‚Äôs someone there to speak for the opposing viewpoint. I love the can‚Äôt let it go segment! It‚Äôs a great way to wrap up the show.,5
Informative but Informal,01/15/2018,JMullane,"This podcast does a great job of covering the massive volume of politics news in a way that keep you informed, maintains an outside perspective (not particularly partisan), and is informal and entertaining. If you are looking for a deep dive into a specific issue you should head to major newspaper articles, but if you want an entertaining overview from knowledgeable people, this is perfect.",5

mickster49,01/23/2018,mickster49,"I love this podcast. The reporters are knowledgable and personable. It feels like they're sitting aropund my dining room table with me talking about subjects that excite us all. And ""Can't Let It Go"" is a welcome bit of relief from the news of the day.",5
Excellent analysis,12/05/2017,Shine1014,Thank you for answering the questions most of us were asking. It's nice to get answers and deeper understanding of news headlines.,5
One of My favorites,12/05/2017,Plantyfinn,"I really enjoy this political gabfest. Tamara Keith is a bright voice for these depressing times (how does she manage to be so cheerful in these political times), and Mara Liasson is always so reasonable and thoughtful. It‚Äôs a pleasant group to spend time with and a nice break from all the noise that‚Äôs out there.",5
Chillin with my peeps,12/07/2017,Walkebb,"Listening to this podcast twice a week, (and sometimes thrice, if it‚Äôs really hitting the fan), feels like I‚Äôm back home arguing the nuances of policy with my equally nerdy friends. Each of the host‚Äôs personalities shine through their rhetoric to deliver that familiar feeling of anticipation that precedes the fulfillment of expectations. Always on point, always poignant, the NPR politics team is my favorite group to listen to during my runs, washing dishes, or really anytime I can find the time!",5
Awesome podcast,12/08/2017,Awesomekate,Highly recommend,5
Perfect balance of news and personalities....,12/08/2017,tjbss,"The group of reporters do a very good job relating the news in a way that is understandable. I find them to be ""human"" and individuals I would enjoy having a conversation with. Ron Elving (spelling??) is someone I especially enjoy as we are of a similar generation. I have ""left"" ears so I hear the podcast to be sypathetic to progressive views, causes, personalities...which I like. It sounds to me to be much more nuances and subtle versus the right wing pundits. I look forward to each episode.",5
With the political front so bleak...,12/11/2017,VanThwaite,"NPR Politics gives me a way to learn about the world with calm. I start every Tues and Fri morning (shows come out Mon and Th) with a dose of the show. Between that and NYT daily email, I keep up with Washington‚Äôs vagaries.",5
Race Tight On Eve Of Election In Alabama,12/13/2017,All That Jacks,"I enjoy the NPR Politics pod. It can be a little cloying, but I enjoy the attempt to be even-handed. Unfortunately, someone told Tamara Keith that she sounds ‚Äúbreezy,‚Äù but she‚Äôs just grating. While reporting on deadly serious issues (that keep me up at night), she sounds as if she finds it all HILARIOUS. Whenever I hear her giggle I want to rip the buds out of my ears. Also, no more good-natured feuds about Sheetz vs. Wa-Wa roadside markets. This was boring, a waste of time and went on way too long.",4
Waiting for Thursday!,12/13/2017,Charolettejane,Thursday is the highlight of my week when I get to listen to this amazingly balanced team. They offer great breakdowns and insights to the world of politics. And might I add...can‚Äôt let it go is truly the best! Try it out you won‚Äôt regret it,5

Of course it has bias,12/13/2017,Mcb2491,"No news is free from bias. What I admire about NPR is that they will call out the left when its faults and praise the right when it has achievements. They may be center left, but they don‚Äôt blindly defend the left",4

Biased ‚Äúreporting‚Äù,12/16/2017,kokitjoe,"This show is ridiculously biased basically a democrat, trump bashing, ‚Äújournalism.‚Äù Which leaves out significant truths. The mueller investigation corruption wasn‚Äôt even mentioned. The Only thing that they focused on is the investigation getting closer to charging trump.

Love the roundups!!!,12/22/2017,Justicejen,These are snippets of the week‚Äôs news presented in a round table roundup format. Very entertaining and meant to be taken lightly.

About the pardoned turkeys....,11/24/2017,planetscooby,"At either Disneyland or Disneyworld, (can‚Äôt remember which one, I think it was California), where there is a petting zoo back in the Wild West area of the park, there are some turkeys with special pens and nameplates stating what President pardoned them.",4
Coming into its own,11/24/2017,ThePrisoner06,"I was one who mourned the loss of the old NPR ""It's All Politics"" with Ron Elving and Ken Rudin. I was delighted when NPR started the Politics Podcast. For those who keep comparing the old to the new, it's time to let go. NPR staff is getting younger, and if NPR is to endure it must attract a younger audience, too. This crew is doing it, and they are doing a good job. The frequent appearances by more seasoned hands like Ron and Mara Liasson add enriching perspective. I'm one of the old listeners (in my sixties) and have spent my share of senior executive time in the DC mill, and still I learn every time I listen. I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if half a star was an option, just because I feel the group are still honing their performances - but I enjoy listening as they do!",5
Can‚Äôt wait for the latest episodes!,11/26/2017,Matthew of Spokane,"I love the jovial reporting and chemistry of the NPR reports. They keep me up to date with the latest news and issues, and more importantly give context and in-depth information to better understand topics. I believe they give a unbiased review of the news, not a spin to further a political agenda.",5
The worst podcast known to man,11/27/2017,boydr,This NPR podcasts should be dumped right away the young podcast journalist who are on the show should be ashamed of themselves I realize they‚Äôre supposed to be entertaining but they take it to the Limit this should be a serious Program on the news of the day in Washington DC instead we get stupid jokes and innuendo about the news.,1
Excellent!,11/28/2017,Amo314,"When this podcast shows up in my feed I listen right away. It's informative and quick.

Why do I hate this podcast?,11/28/2017,anniegrelias,"I used to love everything NPR, however I can‚Äôt stand this podcast. I keep on coming back thinking it must have been an off day. The giggling and cheery tone when discussing such serious and disturbing content is off. Additionally the content is not good. I guess it‚Äôs fine for a ‚Äúquick take‚Äù but if you want to learn anything new or substantive about what is going on in US politics this is not the right podcast.",1
Everything I Need to Stay in the Know,11/29/2017,Jill Klatt,"I'm still relatively new to the podcast world and politics as a topic and community, but over the course of last years' primaries and elections, I've come to know and love this team.

Ugh,11/29/2017,ugh_l,"The political junkie segments/podcasts with just Ron Elving and Ken Rudin used to be so informative and intelligent.

Good ... but badly needs adult supervision!,12/01/2017,UsmanAslamAziz,"I like this podcast and listen to it every week. But that maybe because I am a hopeless news junkie and have nothing better going on in my life. So please be sure to make up your own mind about this podcast and don't pay any attention to this ""five star"" review. Ok ... here are some of my most recent thoughts about this podcast. A) Is it just me or does the stature & quality of this podcast goes way up when Ron and/or Mara are on the panel? If yes ... is adult supervision is what this podcast needs to make it a truly must listen every week? My vote is YES. B) I like Scott Detrow ... but man, he has the worst nasal tone voice I have ever heard. He should definitely go see an ENT specialist just to make sure there is no cotton ball mysteriously stuck in one or both of his nostrils. C) Tamra Keith has the potential to be awesome. What stands in the way is her ever present tendency to chuckle profusely to her own clever lines. If she can only somehow guard against that, she could shoot straight to the top and have her own podcast someday. D) Finally, having Susan Davis & Tamra Keith both on the panel at the same time is ... shall we say an exercise in redundancy! They both talk & sound the exact same! They are like the siamese twins of political commentary!! F) One last thing ... Can't let it go segment is good sometimes, but honestly most of the times it comes through as too cute by half. Do we really need this segment? I think the panel enjoys (and gets amused) by it a lot more than the listeners do. But I suppose no real harm in keeping this segment on.",5
NPR at its best,12/02/2017,SJGust,"If ‚Äúfair and balanced‚Äù were still a positive description, I‚Äôd use it here. NPR expert journalists not only tell you what‚Äôs in the news but why it‚Äôs important and what the background information.

Fact based and human,11/22/2017,Thebriton,Listen to it whenever it comes on. Yes it is NPR which means it‚Äôs fact based. That will be perceived as biased in some quarters. They get into the detail sometimes which is rare nowadays on radio and tv. I get to hear the details about tax bills or gun law or historical perspective. This earnest reporting ( and they have reporters in Washington or flying with the president on foreign trips) is leavened by some jocular commentary at the end of the show about what they can‚Äôt let go.

"(finally) worthy successor ot ""It's All Politics""",11/22/2017,Terry212am,"So, when NPR ended ""It's All Politics,"" I sought out Ken Rudin's ""Political Junkie"" podcast. It's weekly and about 45 minutes to an hour. I love it. I listen every week. When NPR's daily news update advertised THIS podcast, though, I was interested to hear a daily briefing on the RNC/DNC conventions, so I subscribed. Back in 2016, NPR was beding over backward trying to be ""young"" and ""hip"" and not use big words or talk about policy in depth. So that 20-year-olds wouldn't be bored. I guess the message (withering reviews) were received, though, and they retooled the podcast to have youthful energy but restored the intellectual heft. They just did a special on the proposed tax bill in Congress--just the policy, not the politics--and you couldn't ask for more serious analysis and understanding. As of mid-to-late 2017, the contributors are knowledgeable, experienced, and fun but informative and authoritative. And they actually have contact with heavy-hitters in D.C. on a regular basis. This is the best weekly summary of U.S. politics.",5

Grim info presented in fake overly cheerful way,10/31/2017,Matt2685,"I enjoy listening to this podcast, but there is something uncanny about it. They're talking about politics, which these days is almost uniformly bad, grim news, but they present it in a chirpy, chatty, overly mirthful way, regardless of what they're talking about. It's like they're enjoying each other's company so much that they have no tone that's related to what they're presenting. I wish they would strive to present their views in a neutral way. Just report on what's going on in politics, and get rid of the cheery theme song and the personal banter. If you're trying to overcome short attention spans, people with short attention spans aren't listening to this anyway.",3
Thanks,11/02/2017,D -Tron,Thank you so much. Your podcast breaks down politics like no other. Without you my head might explode. Keep up the great work.,5
Love these folks,11/03/2017,Kayspringw,"These reporters do a great fn job and tell it in a not boring manner.
AA+!",5
Love the show,11/03/2017,SinghAP,Helps me catch up on all the crazy,5
Such a good podcast,11/03/2017,ComeOnnn,So good.,5
Political favorite,11/04/2017,WeldChair,My favorite political news podcast from people that are actually in the DC press corps.,5
Solid NPR podcast,11/06/2017,DougUSC,A light-hearted yet informed podcast filled with solid reporting.,5
Amazing,11/07/2017,AnnaBan873636219,Great podcast! Provides lots of thoughtful detail on relevant topics. I also really appreciate the special podcasts that provide analysis around breaking news.,5
Think NPR Meets the View,11/10/2017,GonnaPartyLikeIts1999,I think the low reviews are all from #Cult45 that just can‚Äôt stand facts frequently don‚Äôt support their personal opinions. Seems like a pretty neutral political group with some younger and older perspectives on current events. I personally love the laid back round table style version of talking about the week‚Äôs events and I especially get great joy out of the time stamps and how insane it is that this administration really is.,5
Maria Liasson stop talking over everyone,11/10/2017,Maria Stop,"Love the podcast but Maria Liasson is ruining it. She sounds like a liberal Hannity, just trying to get through her talking points. Cutting off everyone that wants an actual discussion, including women. Politics is about a debate. Maria Liasson lift other women up don't talk over them and as if they are under you.",2
Liberal tilt,11/13/2017,Code locker23479,"It is hard to find an unbiased political podcast. And this one is no different. They don‚Äôt treat all topics with an open mind and don‚Äôt give all of the points to a discussion. There is a liberal flair to this podcast. It would be nice to see them actually try to find talking points from a conservative point of view to show both sides to a story and let the listeners make up their own minds. When a conservative like me listens in, the liberal tone shows up instantly and really turns me off.",2
A go-to show,11/14/2017,Sollmana,"NPR Politics is my go-to podcast for an update in the week‚Äôs political news. It doesn‚Äôt delve into punditry, but provides context where needed. I don‚Äôt miss an episode.",5
Well done,10/07/2017,someneutralcafe,Excellent coverage,5
My go-to politics podcast,10/07/2017,amiddins,"I really look forward to these weekly discussions of political news as a grounding force in an often hysterical political environment. My favorite elements are the inclusion of history (is there a precedent for this?) and pragmatism (how likely is this thing we're talking about to happen and what are the realistic outcomes). It's a refreshing and accessible take on politics. Also, dad jokes.",5
Very informative!,10/10/2017,Ottusch,They hit major topics and give important context.,5
Good Synopsis on what is happening today,10/11/2017,rajaski,I feel like it is hard today to listen to any sort of media outlet that isn't biased towards one side so it's nice to listen to a podcast that tries to just say what is going on today. Sometimes it can be obvious which side they're on but overall I feel like it's a good synopsis of current events.,4
Love this,10/12/2017,KelleyLGirl,It is simply the best political discussion I have heard.,5
Too liberally opinionated,10/13/2017,todds99,"There is a negative spin to every action Trump takes. I would prefer to hear objective discussion that lays out the potential impacts, both positive and negative.",2
Nothing more than Propaganda,10/13/2017,Gary21490,The only good thing about this podcast is that I use it to learn more about what Propaganda the deep state wants to push on us.,1
Under the hood look at politics reporting,10/15/2017,BriRoess,"This is a great show, and one of the things I like most about it is understanding more about how politics reporters approach their work.
I rely on the common sense asides of the podcast as a great way to supplement NPR and other news sources straight forward reporting.",5
Thoroughly enjoyable,10/18/2017,multnomadic,Detro and Keith <3,5
Can‚Äôt let it go,10/18/2017,TheReal Ish,"Hey folks, you had me hooked during the campaign and I still eagerly await every new episode for you to breakdown the up to minute political news. Nowadays it seems like you have your hands full on how fast things change. Thanks for taking the time to put this podcast together including those behind the scenes.",5
Depends...,10/20/2017,Pjded,I love this show now that Sam has his own show and when Tamara K isn‚Äôt hosting. Best when the adults are on who have some experience and history.,2
Clear and concise,10/21/2017,TXSmo,"This show got me through the absolute chaos of 2016. Today, I continue to lean on them to keep me grounded in the hyper-political environment we have currently. There jobs aren‚Äôt easy, but they pull it off week after week! Thanks!",5
Great,10/21/2017,irateviewer123,Love this podcast!,5
Terribly downhill,10/23/2017,Canadiana,"Are used to really enjoy the NPR politics podcast but now they‚Äôve become what I can only describe as political apologists for the current administration. Instead of simply reporting the news, we are told to ‚Äúgive him the benefit of the doubt‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe what he meant to say was this‚Ä¶‚Äù. I thought it was a very bad taste when one of the reporters suggested that Hillary Clinton shouldn‚Äôt have written a book and should probably just go away. That‚Äôs not news. That‚Äôs an opinion and a very one sided one at that. I‚Äôm also irritated with the fact that it seems as though nothing is taken seriously anymore. As though I‚Äôm listening to some corny morning show where they might have cute pet tricks or do some cooking in the middle of the segment. Not the NPR I used to respect.",1
Always enjoyable without being fake,10/23/2017,RobertJDickinson,"Unlike, say, the Upshot, here public radio (usually) gets the balance between conversational spontaneity and insightful analysis. Balanced and useful, as well as entertaining.",2
Love the show but...,10/24/2017,Maxanddan,"I've been listening for a few years but am a bit concerned of comments that could be construed as lacking in objectivity. Keep it real, report the facts, but don't become biased.",4
Good show but consistently left leaning,10/25/2017,tjmcneice,Very helpful show for people who don‚Äôt follow politics and current events on a daily basis. It‚Äôs entertaining and provides some useful insights however it‚Äôs clear they are all slightly to moderately left of center. I think expanding the spectrum of political viewpoints of the hosts would bear more thoughtful and critical discussions. With that being said I do enjoy seeing new episodes popping up on my feed.,3
Count on it,10/25/2017,lballard001,I count on this podcast for honest reporting and empathetic stories.,5
Unbiased reporting alongst unique perspectives,10/25/2017,Jos3_t,"I always look forward to Thursday for the ""Weekly Roundup""!",5
Keeps me informed,10/26/2017,Shonita160,This is the best podcast. I love all the personalities and opinions. I like the 'can't let it go' at the end,5
My favorite pod,09/27/2017,pinetree27,My husband and I look forward to each episode of this podcast coming out as it helps translate so much of the crazy politics going on right now. The NPR politics crew makes the news a little less scary.,5
Great podcast,09/28/2017,Kyle-Tennessee,This is the podcast I look forward to the most every week!,5
In-depth analysis of the news with a bit of comedy thrown in,09/28/2017,NCsoccer44,Love this podcast and listen to it every week.,5
Solid but tries a little hard to be clever,09/28/2017,GMN27701,"I enjoy this show because I can't get enough political commentary these days. And the hosts are wonderfully knowledgeable. My only problem is that it can waffle between being so in-depth one minute (to the point of getting down in the weeds), and so snarky the next minute. I don't love it when the whole thing devolves into banter. All in all, though, I'm smarter for listening to it!",4
"Good, informative and to the point",09/28/2017,winexz,"It is surprising the amount of information that you get in a short amount of time. All the journalists are professional and their only bias is reality. You do get some personal experience but everyone is upfront about who they are (old, young male, female African-American) and how that influences them or what they are saying is their opinion. They all also get along well so you can hear discussion on a topic, versus yelling over each other with talking points you get on a show like Real Time or Left, Right and Center.",5
Great show!,09/30/2017,JD Mejstrik,"Listen every week! Great way to keep
Up to date on the weeks happenings, and their causes and ramifications.",5
Amazing,09/30/2017,Alords,The NPR Politics team is fantastic. They have great chemistry and their points are always concise and accurate. A lot of fun to listen to. Twice a week they break down all the major storylines in Washington. Highly recommended 10/10.,5
Podcast helps me make sense of it all,10/02/2017,Shelly1185,"I love the format and dynamic of this podcast. I look to the reporters' comments each week to stay in the know, but also better understand the biggest news stories. Really enjoy the delivery, how neutral and educated they all are in their own area of expertise.",5
helpful analysis,10/02/2017,lfullerton,I enjoy the podcasts. It helps me put the tsunami of political news in perspective and I also enjoy the interactions between the hosts.,4
NPR Politics,10/02/2017,kmschneid,In depth information with facts out front. NPR is the best.,5
Thoughtful,10/02/2017,San Diego Walker,"I began listening to this podcast during the 2016 Presidential election. At a time when too much political reporting devolved into ""who won and who lost"" today I found this podcast a welcome respite from the gladiator model. Virtually without fail I'll be listening to the discussion and find a question; the next reporter asks the same question and I get the answer I'm looking for. I have friends on both the right and the left and I find (because of this podcast) that I can provide the necessary background for nearly any issue. By the way, I think if Danielle Kurtzleben trademarks the word ""whataboutism,"" NPR will never need to do a pledge drive again.",5
Favorite podcast!,10/03/2017,dcdiner22,NPR Politics is my FAVORITE podcast - I look forward to every new episode and the thoughtful insight that the NPR politics team provides!,5
Intelligent conversations about what‚Äôs happening in politics,10/03/2017,Aresef,"Just the facts, straightforward breakdown of the what and why of American politics in the news this week.",5
Very good podcast.,10/03/2017,Joeblofromidaho,"This podcast is very good, and makes the best out of the daily news. Sometimes I wish it had a little more depth like Politico but that‚Äôs not what it is about.",2
Utterly Disappointing,10/04/2017,Celticspats12,"Considering the caliber of the individual journalist contributors this show simply lacks gravitas and instead brings a jovial conversational style lacking in substantive analysis. Beyond the use of the greeting ‚ÄúHey‚Äù, giggling and fill words like ‚Äúlike‚Äù, which are highly unprofessional and distracting, the superficial observations and dearth of insight make the program unlistenable. Save yourself the time and go elsewhere until this team has a chance to gather themselves, grow up and present a broadcast worthy of NPR.",2
A chance to breathe,10/04/2017,DumpTrump2018,"I listen to this podcast as a welcome escape from the inflammatory rhetoric found on other media. Just when I think others may have already covered the topic adequately, this team comes up with insights others do not consider. Thanks friends! You definitely kept me off the ledge during and after the campaign so I can totally forgive your few flaws.",4
Format,10/06/2017,Schatzi08,Don‚Äôt like the new iPhone 7 update. I like that I‚Äôd listen to a podcast and once the podcast was done it would automatically go to the next podcast. Now it just ends after the one podcast is over. Very annoying,1
Unacceptably apologist. NPR is dead.,10/06/2017,Saakimba!,"Gone are the days when we could turn to NPR for uncompromising reporting of hard truths facing the nation. This ""politics roundup"" is a fluffy, apologist waste of time. They are *literally* the only major news outlet (Fox, et al not withstanding) that still will defend Trump and consistently normalize his horrifying behavior because, every once in a while, he says something vaguely innocuous. Literally as I am writing this, days after the Las Vegas massacre, I am listening to them explaining why ""bump stocks"" have value to gun owners. Screw that. I'm out.",2
Disappointed,10/06/2017,Miss_moo-moo,"I have high standards for NPR but this podcast falls short. I will give it a couple of more listens to see if the tone improves. The podcast I listened to had some serious issues to address (Las Vegas shooting, Trump's PR visit) yet the tone throughout sounded more like I was eavesdropping on a group of friends' conversation then a group of journalists informing me on the week's issues. Please do NOT make the mistake of mainstream tv media. I do not listen to a podcast named ""NPR Politics"" seeking entertainment or cutesy/comedic banter, I actively seek you out to provide professional journalistic reporting and analysis. I will give you a few more listens but you are on probation.",2
"As Politics explainer, good. As Politics pundits, bad",10/06/2017,Conwayman,"When the reporters talk about the subject that they are well versed in and the potential fallout there are few podcasts that can match their expertise. Justice, Foreign Policy, healthcare, etc. But they often dip into the punditry world and simply repeat Washington truisms. And on that foot, the podcast really is the quintessential false equivalence audio explainer for which you've been waiting, normal behavior described as radical and radical behavior described as normal because of ridiculous claims of bias. Anyway it's great when it's good and it's meh when it's bad.",3
One Big Problem,09/20/2017,Argle von Bargle,"Listening to 3-4 journalists try to report around the Trump apologist Mara Liasson gets really exhausitng after awhile. I need a place to hear the news. If I want to hear someone rationalize and attempt to normalize the actions of an insane person, I will go to FOX or some other Cracker Jack outlet. Can't stand much more of her...",3
"Unbiased, informative",09/20/2017,Syxx006,Great information from different perspectives without being overly biased,5
Great politics podcast.,09/20/2017,Poi untreated,"This is a great political podcast. Yes, it's 'left leaning', but they do keep each other in check. If you, like me, listen to BOTH sides (i.e. WSJ Potomac Watch for a 'right leaning' podcast) then you can add this to your subscribe list for a well round set of political podcast to get every angle to make your own decision. They utilize the whole range of NPR staff to get knowledgeable sources. It's a great way to end my week for my Friday morning drive to work.",5
Relatable; insightful,09/20/2017,Denaldi371,"NPR Politics podcast hts the jark - it gets right into the heart of political matters, encourages audience interaction and is responsive to its listeners. It's compelling, entertaining & concise. It's reliably informative.",5
The New News,09/21/2017,Kenelee,"The show offers political background and insight on the politics of the week in a very listenable manner. The coffee-klatch style of the show was off-putting at first to this baby-boomer but these are the same smart reporters that we hear during drive time every day. The DC behind-the-scenes information is often fascinating but fleshing-out the news in a longer format is what makes the show. The mix of old hands and energetic millennials makes for a great show that I look forward to listening to every week. BTW we know that the truth leans left, especially today.",5

Fun and Engaging Way to Stay Informed,09/25/2017,Michael28,"After listening to the podcast for close to a year, I feel like each reporter is an old friend. It's fun and informative to hear the political news discussed in a conversational format. It's my favorite news podcast!",5
I expect better from NPR.,09/25/2017,ClackFlash,I started listening to the NPR political podcast this year with the hopes that it would be a well balanced show. I figured that being federally funded they would represent both sides of the aisle. I was very wrong.,1
I depend on this podcast...,09/25/2017,Really enjoyable podcast,To keep help sort through and make sense of everything that is going on today in politics. It's fun but everyone is also super knowledgable.,5
My favorite podcast!,09/27/2017,Rowdysgirl22,"I don't normally write reviews, but on a whim tonight, I decided to because I literally love this podcast so much, and I hated seeing all the negative reviews when I pulled up the page. I faithfully listen every week, and I feel so much more informed about what's going on politically. It's informal and fun to listen to. And a little shout out to all my favorites: Tam, Sue, Ron, Domenico, Scott and Scott, Mara, Jeff, Danielle, Vanessa, the new guy that I think is named Ryan, and anyone else who regularly speaks on the show, but that I forgot... Thank you all for all your hard work. You definitely make my life better.",5

Helpful,09/17/2017,wingwhir,"I only started listening to this after January 2017, for stress/panic-related reasons that may be obvious, and I've found it helpful in terms of clarifying current events as well as somewhat reassuring in these troubled times. I also like hearing these serious reporters doing their non-radio-report voices.",5
The best way to know your government,09/17/2017,MattChandronait,"We've largely lost ""beat"" reporters; those journalists that spend years and sometimes their whole careers living in and covering a topic. NPR is one of few resources that still values that aspect of the profession. This podcast is one degree away from hanging out inside the halls of the American Congress, White House, and the capitol in general. What's more, in a world of shouters trying to shout over other shouters, it's so refreshing to get analysis and thoughtful detail without the insults and demonization. The Left and Right in the US love to retreat to their corners and listen only to their own echo chambers, and in this sense the NPR Politics podcast is likely to make a lot of people frustrated because they're not just going to tell you what you want to hear. They have empathy for everyone across the electorate and try to cover all the communities they come across while traveling with campaigns, on Air Force one, hanging out at state fairs, or just talking in their studio in Washington DC. They rotate their cast based on who can best speak to whatever is going on in the moment so in about 30-45 minutes a week you're going to feel caught up on everything critical in the political landscape of the United States. And, even better, from journalists who will make you think about and feel the real world around you. It's impossible to overstate the importance of being knowledgeable about the folks in your government making decisions every day that can drastically affect you and everyone you know. This podcast is the very best way to get that knowledge.",5

Casual Politics,09/13/2017,Carly_Carly_Carly_Carly,"This podcast has been my jam since the 2016 primaries. It's like listening to a bunch of smart friends casually chat about politics. It's a great way to stay up to date in the news. They're really good at explaining things, so it never goes over your head. One of my favorites. I feel like Ron, Dominico, Tam, & Sue are my personal friends.",5
Solid political news podcast,09/14/2017,Amar Kelkar,"It's part of my weekly political news rotation, but not quite the must-listen FiveThirtyEight politics podcast.",4
Good Review of the News,09/14/2017,DanMcFan,I like it.,5
Great balance of news and commentary,09/14/2017,EricGuy,"I really enjoy this podcast for what it is. It seems to me to be a blend of news and commentary. The cast tries to balance breadth and depth in their show, which is likely never to be perfect. Many other people who rated this podcast lamented the lack of depth; however, I think that it would be a mistake to call this podcast dumbed down. Rather, I think the cast tries to put news into helpful context and largely succeeds in this endeavor. Could they potentially dive deeper? Sure. Could there be less banter and more sober analysis? Sure. But I think the scope of this podcast is a good one that is worthy of pursuit, and the crew does a great job.",5
Great show,09/14/2017,Ivylvine,Love the reporters. Easy to relate to and they are biased. Wish it was more than twice a week.,5
An easy way to keep up,09/15/2017,2muchJazz,"This podcast has been my saving grace in the midst of the most exhausting season of politics. I love talking politics and this podcast feels like having my nerdy college friends sitting around a table with coffee and tea and talking about all of the important headlines. It's refreshing and honest, but occasionally so focused on sounding ""unbiased"" it fails to speak forthrightly, but it's great. I recommend it to all my friends, especially ones that don't like politics because this podcast is so accessible. I learn something new every week.",5

Ughh..,09/13/2017,AWESOME game !!! Add more,I really wanted to like this podcast but instead I found it to be highly irritating. Way too jokey and young. I appreciate some witty humor here and there but most of what I hear is corny. It needs to be balanced out with more discussion & insight.

The People magazine of politics podcasts,09/03/2017,haidozo,"I've tried to get behind this podcast, but I just can't.

Excellent,09/04/2017,g-p-,"Even though I keep up with the news throughout the week, the NPR Politics team always enlightens and informs me. I feel like I understand the news better after hearing from them. And it feels more like listening to really smart friends than hearing the news.",5

First podcast I subscribed to,09/07/2017,adeekd,"I really like this NPR politics podcast. I feel like it picks the biggest stories of the week and delves a bit more in depth with history and further context that I do not receive in the brief snippets I watch on the news or read online. I do admit, I miss their old team during the presidential race. That seemed more informative whereas the new format is a bit more ""light"" and informal. That is the only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5. Their old team I truly can say was completely factual and devoid of bias. The new way sometimes jokes a bit which always reveals a slight his. Overall though I feel like it is a very unbiased and nonpartisan podcast on today's news. Keep with the facts NPR, you're doing great! I know I have been able to count on you to provide little to no bias in your reporting.",4

Way Better Than Average,09/08/2017,R from Indiana,"Having never heard the previous iterations of NPR's political programming, I can neither agree nor disagree with the other reviewers' comments. I can only compare this podcast with other ones I listen to. I like it. It's informative without getting lost in the minutiae of politics; it's serious without being argumentative. I think they've struck a nice balance.",4
Love it!,09/08/2017,HMHGinger,Two doses a week of just straightforward breakdown of politics is keeping me sane and not overwhelmed with my former diet of 24 hours of news with the major networks and WaPo and NYT and Economist articles. Now I go for more information only when it intrigues me instead of a steady and toxic diet that was sapping my productivity! Thanks guys!,5

Unbearable,08/27/2017,RP11374,"I have been a devoted (Millennial!) listener since the beginning. Post-Sam Sanders, this show has become absurd and entirely indulgent. Tamara and Dominico are particularly difficult to tolerate. No poignant information is delivered, only the nuances of the team's opinions. These are neither witty nor relevant. Only occasional highlights: Ron and Mara. Get it together, NPR.",1

Not worth any time in your life,08/31/2017,Need News!,Three times I've subscribed because I am looking for excellent news analysis. This is NOT it. Everything is about the 'optics' of the news and nothing of substance. A horse race or a football game maybe but it has no meaning. Lots of giggling back and forth.

Up First is always first and NPR Politics is second--even before Wait, Wait... I rely on this podcast to keep me up to speed on what is going on in Washington and around the world, since I often can't listen to all of Morning Edition or ATC. I really appreciate the various different voices on the podcast, although my favorite is Editor/Correspondent Ron Elving. He has the wisdom of having seen and done a lot. I also appreciate the humor--I could listen to the Beeb if I wanted seriousness all the time.",5
Where was this podcast when we needed it?,08/20/2017,coleenjo,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this podcast; it's become the only political reporting I can listen to during the trump era.

Decades from now, historians will be dissecting these podcasts to understand the context of our current times. But lucky us, we get to hear that stuff right now. The importance of a loud, consistent, adversarial process is as important today as it was at the founding of this great nation ‚Äì and without podcasts like this one, to tell plain truth and hold accountable those in power, the great nation's future is in peril.",5

SAM Sanders Ruined this Show,08/10/2017,Andrew Crivilare,Sam Sanders took a humorous podcast about political analysis and turned it into a dumbed down series of call back jokes. These are great journalists on this show that need a stronger producer to guide them. Bring back Ken Rudin.,1

Musician loves Politics Podcast,07/24/2017,Aeasoprano,Thank you to the NPR Politics Podcast for keeping me sane during this election season. I've been listening with the religiosity and fervor of a recent convert.

Addicted,07/25/2017,lafreier,"The show keeps me up to date.

Started strong - getting weak,07/27/2017,Grandesid,"This show started strong early in the campaign.

Hurrah for Layman's Politics,07/16/2017,RealArtNerd,NPR Politics is great for a liberal listening base that wants a summary of the week's events without having to go deep into headlines or T.V. news.

Balanced Political Updates,06/23/2017,Mr. Rokyo,"Despite what a few recent reviews have said, I find this podcast to be the most honest and unbiased report of political news. I try to listen to all the viewpoints and purposefully listen to podcasts slanted to the left and the right so that I can get both sides of the argument. But they are always very clearly slanted. The NPR Politics podcast is one of the few good ones that stays as middle of the road as possible. They give the facts and generally do not add additional opinion comments.",5
Love the dynamic,06/23/2017,Wrenster pinster,These guys make me want to be in the room with them. So many years of experience.,5

RON ELVING SUPERSTAR,07/01/2017,Montreal Student,Fun and professional. Great show. I think the team works hard to give an informative and unbiased perspective - without normalizing the craziness. Nice alternative to daily yelling segments on cable shows. Only downside = not enough Ron Elving!!,5
Not impressed,07/03/2017,TheDudeAbided,"This is informal and loose to the point where it begins to just sound lightweight. Tamara Keith sounds like Lena Dunham's evil twin, which is disconcerting. If this were a bunch of amateur college radio DJs arguing over who were better, Television or The Strokes, I could handle it, but for incisive analysis of today's grievous political situation, it hardly seems appropriate. We need more informed journalism, not more people sitting around bloviating. ""We're so millennial and we are so totally like going to explain the news to you"" gets real old fast.",2
Great podcast!,07/03/2017,ToasterGhost,A great political podcast that does its best to stay apolitical. Ron Elving is pretty much my hero.,5

Even better than the regular NPR news,06/12/2017,keith-meister,"What I appreciate most is the more relaxed, conversational approach to the topics.

Enjoyable podcast!,06/01/2017,terrilee_nc,"Here's where the NPR political correspondents put off their serious newsy voices, kick off their shoes and have fun with the political circus. I didn't start listening to this podcast till after the election - I note the reviews from a year ago were largely negative. Now, of course (unfortunately) there's a lot more material to work with! This isn't meant to be a primary source or in depth analysis-it's too lightweight; more like dessert to serious NPR. However, I still occasionally learn something new!",4
Good overview,06/02/2017,RivertonRocker,"It's good, not too deep but good",5

as unbiased as you can get,06/06/2017,reganmarie93,"I really appreciate how unbiased this podcast is. They work hard to just deliver the facts, and stifle their horror at the absurdity of this Trump Administration- something that's exceptionally hard to do!!",5
Keep on diggin in,06/08/2017,Cgumpdesign,"I really appreciate that NPR politics keep diving into the tough topics. I encourage anyone who wants to just listen to someone that agrees with you should not listen to this podcast. But for the moderates like me who want to chew on those tough topics and really dive into the political atmosphere, you won't be able to get enough of this podcast.",4

"If you follow politics, this is a must listen",05/18/2017,Lukeout,"I've listend to this podcast for a long time, and I've always liked it. During the election, I felt they went pretty soft (afraid to call a spade a spade as it were). But over the last few months, they have stepped up their game. The ""I hope you can let this go"" episode was the one that made me write this review. No nonsense, clear information, delivered without undue passion. They give clear answers to questions we should all be asking. It also gives you a real understanding for what it's like to ""be in the room where it happens."" Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.",5
My go-to politics podcast,05/19/2017,Jamandymoo3,"When I'm not overwhelmed with the political news of the day, I will most definitely listen to this podcast for their scoop. I love the candor between all the journalists and the detail they provide.",5
Fun analysis,05/19/2017,Kate368955,"I like their attitudes, and I especially like that they so frequently invite people who actually work to cover the White House, it's an interesting insiders view of the madness going on. Refreshing and fun listen after feeling gloomy all day about the news.",5
My favorite way to get the news,05/19/2017,kristin_11,I don't like the sensationalism of most news outlets so I subscribe to this podcast instead. It's a great way to get the important political news in a clear and rational way and I really like all the reporters who rotate through.,5
From the Beginning,05/20/2017,bibisloan,"I have been listing to the NPR Politics podcast since it began. It got me through the election and is still keeping me well informed, in doses I can stand.",5
Great,05/20/2017,foglandia,"Okay, I miss Sam Sanders, but the team is great. The more Maura Liassin, the better. Solid reporting and analysis all around.",5
The podcast that got me into political news!!,05/22/2017,Chicostix89,"NPR politics podcast feels star studded. I feel like you get to know everyone on this show. This podcast has made me vigilant to political news and even made me give news a second chance, even if all the news I listen to is podcasted. Their layout is perfectly orchestrated and time is done just long enough to leave you wanting for more.",5
Horrible.,05/23/2017,Lxa739,Moving on.,1
Personable Politics,05/25/2017,Djgardne,The personalities on the show are very approachable. I've been listening to this show since the conventions in 2016. I've gotten to know the team - making it feel like it's some friends coming over to talk politics. It's got a nice mix of descriptions (making things understandable) and funny comments. It's in my feed and I look forward to the next.,5
Scott Detrow needs Ritalin,05/26/2017,Ambiverbal,"I want desperately to like this podcast, but with Scott Detrow at the helm, distracting, intelligence-insulting, and ""Squirrel!""-like questions have made it unlistenable.",2

Smart Discussion of Politics,05/31/2017,TracyStoller,The rotating cast of NPR political reporters have insightful discussions of whatever is currently happening in politics.,5
How Stupid Do They Think We Are?,05/06/2017,CultureWarsVet,"NPR Politics offers information and analysis from top-tier journalists. Terrific. But its Intro is terrible. It has a listener read a trigger warning "" . . . things may have changed by the time you hear it."" Are podcast listeners so stupid that they need to be cautioned that things change?",3
"Very informative, and I really like the commentators",05/07/2017,Gumpster2010,"It's hard and overwhelming to take in the full news cycle every week, especially from the more serious news sources... it's easy to be upset by NYT headlines or whatever 24-7 punditry is happening on the TV news outlets. I really like the NPR Politics podcast because it sums up the political news that I care about BUT the conversation is even-keeled and they're good at not making it panicky. Honestly, it makes me feel better about whatever's happening",5
I like it,05/08/2017,Jedibrat,Trying to be more informed and this is great way to start paying more attention.,5
I'm learning all about politics!!,05/09/2017,Captain Terminator,Love the podcast! Wish I could listen every day! I never paid much attention to politics until Trump was elected and the I realized I NEED to learn more and now I never miss a show. Thanks for all you do!,5
One of my Favorite Podcasts,05/09/2017,mlm0208,"This podcast is one of my favorites! They have intelligent discussions on political issues that we need to know about. I wish it was daily and there was a little more debate on topics, but overall I love it and it's the highlight of my week!!",5

Makes me like learning about politics,05/09/2017,Hayleymouse,I started listening just a few months ago after being woefully uninformed about politics for some time. I look forward to the episodes and it helps me to engage in intelligent conversations with others about current events. The hosts are interesting and make it easier to understand the specifics of politics. Thanks NPR!,5
Better than cable news,05/11/2017,Katnpp,More background on the current issues without the cable news bias.,5
Great podcast,05/11/2017,symesgc,"Always high quality, great team",5
Hey y'all,05/12/2017,Huntcw,"I was worried things would fall apart after the election. But the NPR Politics team is going strong and adding some great new voices.

I love this podcast!,05/12/2017,Creative Task Master,"This podcast is addictive and fun. I'm curious about the ins-and-outs of politics, but I'm not into doom and gloom. I don't want to listen to the news and fret that the world is coming to an end. For me, this podcast, with its upbeat tone and personality, is a welcome and digestible way for me to understand what's happening in Washington and what it means. The tone helps me stay present with the complexity of the goings on and allows me to smile as the hosts filter through the news with a helping of humor (often making fun of themselves).",5

Gets to caught up in the horse race,04/23/2017,Freelancer 170,"Considering this is an NPR podcast, one would think it would offer clear analysis and coverage of topics of substance. Lately this podcast has been covering more of the minutiae of the Trump presidency such as his tweets and who is up and who is down among the Whitehouse staff. Furthermore the analysis of what they cover is just not smart, insightful or helpful. It's becoming the Politico of political podcasts. Sometimes worth a listen but mostly noise from talking heads. This does a disservice to the NPR brand. Slate Political Gabfest is far superior.",2
"Hate politics, love this show",04/24/2017,Mortimermer,I've never been interested in politics but find myslef in a time where I need to be somewhat informed or at least up to date on the goings on around me. I tried starting with this pod and was instantly hooked.,5

"Enjoyable, except for Mara",04/26/2017,Mpozniak,"I searched for a long time to find a news podcast that was intelligent, informative and as unbiased as possible. For the most part, I feel the NPR Roundup and Political podcasts meet these requirements. My only complaint is with Mara. She is SO combative when speaking about President Trump. It is this kind of reporting that I find distasteful. I don't mind a hit of personal political opinion to seep into a discussion, but she is just over the top. Whatever information she is trying to impart to me is lost in her angry and combative tone. I find myself fast forwarding through her contributions. This is a shame. I feel she could be a wonderful contributor, if there was less of an antagonistic tone to her reporting. I do love NPR, and all the work done for local radio and podcasts.",4
This is my favorite podcast,04/26/2017,Ohmycatness,"As a layman, I feel like this show is super dense, and that's what I like. I want to learn the in-depth, complicated, pervasive aspects of issues. Well done.",5

Great basic political news,04/28/2017,Ndubs23,"There's not any amazing insight or deep detail here; however, I don't think that's the goal of this podcast.

I look forward to seeing new episodes download weekly and feel like I get a lot of straightforward and insightful information without being overwhelmed. The lighthearted commentary often makes me laugh and feel as if the team is very personable.

Fun and very informative!,04/18/2017,A.J Sanch,I've enjoyed this podcast throughout the entire 2016-2017 election and during Trump's 100 days.

Disappointing,04/19/2017,Tripp sound man,"This is one of the most biased ""news"" cast I've ever heard. It doesn't even qualify as news. It's more like really bad editorial. Unapologetically leftist while giving lip service to be objective. So disappointing.",1

CNN lite,03/26/2017,Warren Lanphier,I enjoy all of the NPR podcasts. Today was the first time I listened to the politics podcast. It felt like I was listening to naive college students talk politics not professional journalists. It sounded as if they were excited about the failures of the week rather than irritated at the failures of the week in Washington. A failed Trump presidency or a failed Ryan House is not a win for anyone on either side of the aisle it's a loss for all of us. I want to hear journalists report news and original thought not a repeat of Morning Joe or the like. Also don't let your journalists use the word like as a colloquial adverb.,3
Longtime Listener Love,03/26/2017,niqbailey,"I've been listening to the NPR Politics team for more than a year, since it came though my NPR One feed, and I've been hooked since their coverage of the primaries.

"OK, but Tamara Keith is intolerable",03/26/2017,Siggy Javotnik,"First, there was the episode where Keith said that when Trump was saying stupid things about Frederick Douglas, black people in the room laughed, ""there was a warmth there."" No, Tamara, black people laugh at stupid powerful white men as a defense mechanism. Then she talked about her dog meeting Trump and Gorsuch. She's normalizing Nazis, and the dog comments make her our generation's Eva Braun. Listen to FiveThirtyEight Politics for a decent podcast.",1
YUS,03/26/2017,TiffMightBeHome,I love the charisma between everyone on the show. I love that it is pretty unbiased. I love that everyone on the show brings something different to the table.,5
Great,03/27/2017,Stukish,Truly one of my favorite podcasts. I have it set to automatically download and I never miss an episode.,5
Great overview,03/27/2017,T.L.56,This podcast gives a good overview of the various U.S. political events that are occurring.,5
On my last nerve,03/27/2017,TiffReviews14,"Since the election I have become more and more annoyed with folks on here. I started listening and enjoyed because it felt informative and unbiased, however it is seemingly less and less that way. It's especially apparent if you follow NPR politics on twitter. The account retweets the podcasters ""personal"" biased tweets. That is unacceptable to me. I'm so disappointed. If it continues I will be unsubscribing and leaving a 1 star review. Get it together please. Do your jobs with integrity please and stop retweeting the snark.",2
A practical tool in stressful times...,03/27/2017,HPod3695,"I really love NPR Politics as a great source for recapping major events in this crazy time when politics seems to be a hot issue for everyone. I enjoy the teams balanced reporting of all sides of what's going on. Definitely not ""fake news""!",4
yikes,03/28/2017,Dustinteractive,not enough depth... a little too much biasm.,1
Broken hearted,03/30/2017,frostagirl,Man! I am bummed. I love love NPR. But this political podcast is very one sided. I wish it was more in the middle. I thought I could trust NPR to tell more of the truth. You need to watch your prose.,2
get to know the NPR behind the news,03/31/2017,Andrew Bohrer,"It's still professional, journalistic standards, but it's the smartest people on politics explaining what's going on behind the news. There is no weak link, every reporter has so much to offer to every episode. The best, objective podcast on politics.",5
Analysis not just headlines,03/31/2017,LNE4444,"The podcast goes beyond simply reading headlines and provides in depth analysis so listeners can put the news in context and understand the ""so what?"" of current politics. It's the best podcast out there and each week I can't wait to hear the new episodes.",5
My favorite podcast,03/10/2017,Cbrydle,Title says it all.,5
Keeps Me Plugged into Politics,03/10/2017,iPad4TeMo,This podcast keeps me so connected with the important things in the political arena but does so in layman terms and all while being unbiased. I'm always looking forward to a new episode.,5
Great work!,03/11/2017,Jeffsimp234,This podcast helps feed my addiction of political coverage. They are very good at exposing arguments on both sides and helping you understand both the legal and political motivations behind them,5
Good show,03/12/2017,Lorima,I like it.,5
Great insight and personalities,03/13/2017,dsamuelson86,"It has been a joy to listen to this podcast since it began back during the early days of the presidential campaign. I have loved getting to know the hosts and contributors and have always found the commentary to be insightful and balanced. This truly is my favorite podcast I listen to, and I look forward to it every week. I feel like I am listening to a group of my (very well informed) friends discuss current events when I tune in. Obviously we all miss Sam now that he has ""moved on,"" but I would love to send a ""Hey y'all"" from NC where we really do say that.",5
Love it!,03/14/2017,Jaci Trz,My favorite podcast! Both funny and informative! Love the hosts!,5
Finally. Now you're speaking to me,03/15/2017,Sundidi,I appreciated how informative and easy this is to listen to. They are very good at identifying the difference between what has been confirmed and what's a bunch of speculation. We could use more of that.,5
I miss Sam and Asma,03/17/2017,Gojetzoff,"I always listen to whatever new feed comes in from the NPR politics team, but the show has felt a little deflated since Sam and Asma left. No offense, all! Have really enjoyed the show since I began about a year ago. Always the first podcast I listen to when it updates.",4

Mara needs to go...,03/17/2017,Michelle A. L.,"She‚Äôs negative, clearly biased & tilts extremely right. Her Fox affiliation alone is reason enough for me to discontinue listening to the podcast. I‚Äôll stick with The Daily, Pod Save America & Pod Save The World.",2
You all make my life easier.,03/17/2017,Gagaaboutgaga,"I cannot express enough how much time and anxiety this podcast saves me. I'm a doctoral student who after classes, teaching, grading, writing can total out the week with 60-70 hours, easily.",5

This podcast keeps me sane!,03/21/2017,Sara DC,"I discovered the podcast in the fall at the height of the election excitement, and I continue to look forward to each episode appearing in my feed. The calm, rational, informative, intelligent presentation by the entire podcast team has enabled me to stay very well informed about all that it going on in politics without getting too activated or upset. I feel like a responsible citizen, because I'm partaking of fair, balanced, accurate media. And the rapport among the team members is entertaining and comforting. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5
I just can't like it,03/21/2017,–¢–∞ –î–µ–≤–æ—Ç—á–∫–∞,"I listened to this podcast for a few months, but couldn't get over the clear bias and the giddy, self-indulgent banter between the hosts.",2
Multiple Voices,03/05/2017,geedebee,"I'm not familiar with the IAP comparisons, but I enjoy that this show has more than one or two voices involved with most segments. It is nice to bring in several angles at once.",5
Curation Needed,03/05/2017,palmegr,"Long time NPR listener, recent podcast subscriber. I‚Äôve listened to 15 episodes, and while I like the candid banter my overall enjoyment is hampered by the lack of curation. The time I have for my beloved podcasts is precious and limited. I‚Äôd love if they‚Äôd spend some more time in the planning and editing to shorted and sharpen their commentary.",4

Devoted listener,03/08/2017,Swishkat,"I don't have to tell you how great this podcast is, right? I wait breathlessly for each new episode. My only complaint is that, while I agree completely with the correspondents' left-leaning politics, I do wish they would make more of a good-faith effort to explore opposing viewpoints. It's really important to know both WHAT and HOW conservatives are thinking right now.",4
Every citizen needs this in their life,03/08/2017,btzeee,The most perfect way to stay in touch with the policial environment we're in while still not feeling overwhelmed with it all. The team is made up of such amar and open minded people that really helps you form your own educated opinions on issues that matter.,5
This is a fun podcast,03/08/2017,Teethbrush,Not a deep political discussion but such a fun listen. Love the crew and I don't miss an episode. A lot of the negative reviews are looking for a different type of show. This is young political reporters being themselves and having fun. 1A is a good listen if you want in depth political debates.,5
A must subscribe!,03/08/2017,Krazeydad,I have been listening to this podcast for well over a year and look forward to it each and every week. It's a must subscribe to anyone who likes to keep up with major political items that doesn't have time to watch the news. Keep up the great work!,5
Fantastic!,03/08/2017,BlackBatOnTheInside,"The hosts have great personalities and varying perspectives and experiences.

Too much liberal whining,03/08/2017,ReneeWebb12,"Now that Trump won, much to the cast's dismay and confusion, this podcast is turning into liberal handwringing. This is not a balanced podcast. It's not informative. They just spent several minutes blathering about queso cheese.",2

Formerly great. Losing its impartiality.,03/10/2017,Jfcbsvbjjffbk,"During the election their generally impartial reporting was refreshing and superb. Since Mara Elias has joined, however, her unprofessional naked bias has damaged the balance of impartial reporting that initially drew me in. Though I happen to share some (only some) of her opinions I tune in to this show to hear the political news interpreted by professionals who do not color the news with their opinions. This used to be a five star show. Perhaps the best NPR had to offer. I hope she can become more professionally or that she finds another job.",3
Extremely fair and unbiased,02/23/2017,Time Memorial,"Extremely professional and honest reporting. Great guests and informative discussion. Unlike the new popular The Daily podcast from NYT, this show gives straight news and analysis without leading narratives.",5
Biased and Boring,02/23/2017,KaladinStormblessed,"I love other NPR podcasts and radio, but these broadcasters are the ultimate annoyance: pretend to be bipartisan while they are blatantly biased. Don't insult our intelligence. We hear your obvious bias leaking through when you fudge the facts to fit your liberal narrative. Unprofessional, not to mention dry and boring. STICK TO THE FACTS, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT FEELINGS.",1

As Real as it Gets,02/25/2017,qwak,"If you get your news from Fox- those creepy predators and drug addicts like O'Reilly and Limbaugh- you MUST listen here.

Can't live without,02/26/2017,abeyham81,I will already move this to the number one spot on my listening queue. The NPR politics team helps me understand so much of what happens in government and politics and what it all means. Plus they bring my ears beautiful joy as Vocalness.,5

Would be better if less partisan,03/01/2017,Yehkridbhwje,As a moderate/independent it's hard to listen to a podcast that continually hammers anything that doesn't align to a far-left ideology. Loosen the partisanship and podcast will improve,1
Better than all that fake news out there,03/02/2017,Bracy Knight,"I turn to NPR politics for a deep, and still heaps of fun, digest of what has been happening in politics. More than 60 seconds on a topic, the reporters do a wonderful job of putting the news into context.",5
What happened?,03/03/2017,henion,"Been listening to the NPR politics for months, fair assestment of happenings. March 2 was a unexpected turn to junevile analysis.",1

"Fun, informative",03/04/2017,rhymeswithsnake,"It's a fun, informal take on politics. They talk through the issues in a fun, informal and engaging way with lots of expert guests. It's not CSPAN but it is a good jumping off point for learning more about politics.",5
Illegal immigration,03/04/2017,M. Magice,"Podcast is extremely dishonest!

Being in another country without legal authority is a crime all over the world! The punishment is always deportation!",1
My go-to politics source,03/04/2017,z109620,"For better or worse, I get most of my news from podcasts. And the NPR politics is one of my favorite sources! Informative, thought provoking and entertaining. The views are a bit left of center, however, I feel the reporting is for the most part fair and balanced. Thought to get the conservative point of things, you might want to check out a WSJ podcast. Also, Fivethirtyeight is a good source for a more liberal point of view.",5

Used to love it. Now too much.,02/16/2017,PercussionLife,Can't take it anymore. Used to love it. This was my favorite pod cast. Now I delete it nearly every time without listening. I was glad when one of the old hosts left. So sick of his Beyonc√© crud and crying on tape. But now it's just biased anti trump stuff. :-(,1
Love the diverse panel!,02/16/2017,Collegestuxent,I'll definitely miss Sam Sanders,5
Improved,02/16/2017,snarematt,"Recent changes have improved the quality of the show considerably. Previous criticism of the show was spot on- ""sophomoric"". The new host dynamic is much more professional, but still fun.",5
Great podcast,02/16/2017,Saddielad,This is one of my favorite podcasts! They get the information out soon after events. During the 2016 election I listened everyday and now I am always just waiting for the next release.,5

NPR or CNN?,02/17/2017,themidwestprofessor,Light on facts painting a biased picture of the truth.,1
Typical,02/17/2017,wkpierce,"I've been trying to stomach this show since before the election, but I'm just reminded, every episode that it is the same as the rest of the coverage that politics is getting across the media spectrum. If you like that stuff, if you like the pop-culture of politics styled news media, this will be right up your alley. I think that this podcast successfully hits the highlights with snarky sarcasm, but to think that the npr politics podcast could be unbiased or more inclusive of other narratives than the typical left wing opinion is simply too much to ask I guess. I wish this were not the case. I love listening to npr in general, and their news coverage in the past has seemed to be more even keeled. This is not that. Enjoy it if you want. But I do not.",2

"Informal, accessible, digestible, and informative news podcast",02/14/2017,iphone AppStore reviewer,"This is my favorite politics podcast.

Absolutely critical!,02/14/2017,shantyballa,"In this age of click bait on the web and sensationalism on the TV and Radio, the NPR Politics Podcast is so vital. It lays out all the facts on current issues in our politics, not just the ones that will please their audience the most. They don't make out every story to be cataclysmic in hopes that listeners will keep tuning in, but if a big story breaks they typically put out an extra episode.",5
Keep it up!,02/14/2017,Chris5$82?5,"Thank you for your tireless efforts. The tone of this show is so wonderfully whimsical, and it amazes me how you guys do it. Informative and incisive, this show is a breath of fresh air.",5

Liberal???,02/05/2017,Maddening,"I sometimes Enjoy the podcast but as a conservative, I mostly listen to hear the ""other side's"" take into the news or lack of coverage there of. Hosts seem really young and snarky. As an older guy, I have lived through most of the stuff they read and comment about this election cycle. Wish we had a conservative pod cast on NPR. Still listening and almost complete every podcast. However lately I have been stoping early and waiting for the next one. But the young hosts really don't get the conservative mind set. They seem to think we are all uneducated boobs. Well with two advanced degrees I am conservative, well above middle class, and not a mouth breather. Still listening but not sure for how much longer. Disappointed:(",1

This eclectic group of NPR journalists do an outstanding job of breaking down the issues and getting past the headlines. I look forward to every episode and cannot find a more fair and balanced political podcast out there.",5
Ehh it's okay I guess,02/07/2017,Badger566372,I was told this was an insightful podcast that would shed light on the issues of today. Instead it's a few people attempting to curtail the ramblings of a seemingly elderly and befuddled man who appears hellbent on swinging his viewpoint to the right in order to keep the podcast in the center. It just makes Ron seem foolish. You're better off listening to 538 Politics for statistical analysis or Pod Save America for genuine discussion of this madness that we have descended into.,2

The hosts filter what we should be listening to, gives analysis like your smart but funny friend, and generally makes a chaotic world more approachable. There are certainly more analytical political podcasts out there, but if you like but lighthearted and serious, download the NPR One app and you can get both the NPR Politics podcast and standard NPR news.",5

Great coverage,02/03/2017,tpicther15,Perfect!,5
This is not normal,02/03/2017,Jamil.H.,"I listened to the pre election coverage and felt informed. Since then, the correspondents' forced normalization of the current administration's actions force me to find another news source. Betsy DeVos did not have 'an uneven performance in her confirmation hearing', she demonstrated no comprehension of education policy.",1
I love this podcast,02/03/2017,Jcm132,"It's honestly so entertaining, you'll get the most relevant facts along with a laugh or two.",5
"Informative, fact based, unbiased and still light.",02/03/2017,Pedcal85,"It's a great way to stay up to date, or get a better understanding at some of the news stories that might first sail just over your head. And most importantly, it's not overly dry and boring. It's actually a lot of fun and there is some good friendly banter.",5
Not too sharp,02/03/2017,Talola,The hosts have trouble distinguishing between what's trivial & what's critical in current political situation. Get enough of that on TV news. There are much better political podcasts out there now.,2

Tepid,02/03/2017,AnneDeC,"Meandering & repetitious conversation, spotlight-grabbing host, comments left dangling & topics not thoroughly discussed, too many ""ums"": this podcast pales in comparison to the WashPo ""Can He Do That?""

"Good, informative, objective",02/04/2017,MEG411,"This podcast helped me get through the election season.

Balanced commentary with a good dose of snark,02/04/2017,Sg153,"I found the politically commentary in here very balanced, bi-partisan and fair. They add in a healthy dose of snark when it's warranted but otherwise maintain a very neutral point of view to give you the facts and inside scoop.

Great an√°lisis and very entertaining,02/01/2017,Superman234,"Great podcast. I love the analysis and the objectivity that they maintain even as the political world crumbles around them.

Explains everything!,02/01/2017,Kananana1,"I listen to the NPR politics podcast nearly every week. It has been my best friend throughout the election cycle because it explains everything I need to know, without telling me how to think.",5
Great info,02/01/2017,Mandy2214,"I am still trying to figure out what ""side"" I align with and I love this podcast. I feel like I get both sides of the argument and they ""dumb it down"" so everyone understands what the issues are where other groups are coming from and what they have found. Like everything there will always be another side but I like how this group strives to get the back up or questions each other for where they got the information.",5
Informational without being dry,02/01/2017,Hawtsperrrrrr,"This is a good, basic, informative podcast that you can rely on for honest reporting and a general overview of what's going on, while offering an entertaining aspect. It's a great jumping off point to go and investigate further, but should be a starting point for informing yourself, not an ending point.",4
"Literally, invaluable reporting",02/01/2017,BenDuffie,"I have listened to this podcast for years, it is first form and now it's current form. NPR's politics team are some of the most intelligent and thoughtful reporters I have ever heard.

Fantastic!,02/01/2017,bazanardi,Really good commentary and insightful discussion. Can't wait to hear more.,5
A bit too smug and snarky IMO,02/01/2017,Mint2tch,"Overall I like this podcast for the information it gives and it's entertainment value. I will continue to listen to it as long as I can get past the snarky, smug little laughs that constantly come from the ladies in particular. You might think that all the laughing and giggling they did about GOP losing and then being so wrong would have knocked them off their high horses a bit, but it's not so. They really act like they have 100% knowledge of everything and Trump is just a fool. And while I get that, because he behaves like an idiot far too often, perhaps the hosts need take their job more seriously and start looking at things a little more intricately.",3
"Brian (St. Louis, MO)",02/01/2017,"Brian - St. Louis, MO","I never heard ""It's All Politics,"" so I can't compare this to anything.

Really great analysis on what's going on.,02/01/2017,Lynnoalive,"Unlike some of the other podcasts, this one doesn't have people laughing and joking or talking about their personal lives.

Great at Cutting Through the Mess!,01/31/2017,Morgan in Iowa,"Love how these journalists use their years of news coverage and research in a way that isn't policy-heavy but still informative. They do a great job of untangling difficult issues, especially when so many news sources only report one side or one fact, since most issues require several facts to bring it all together. Really enjoy their lighthearted side too!",5
Invaluable,01/30/2017,jll423,"I am so grateful to the NPR Politics team for taking the time to break down everything going on in American politics.

Intro to Politics,01/26/2017,kellovelie,"As someone who has admittedly been uneducated with regards to politics, this podcast has been an excellent introduction to today's issues.

Quick review on what happened in Politics,01/29/2017,Totony 0607,I like the way they talk about what happened lately on US politics. They answer questions on how US politcs work,5
Who is this for?,01/29/2017,liamdonovan18,"For some reason the hosts seem much more interested in discussing pop culture and sharing the latest Twitter jokes and giving us the news. This should be apparent by the fact that there is an entire segment dedicated to discussing things that have nothing to do with politics. I suppose this is done to attract young listeners, but then aren't we younger listeners already in that loop anyway? What the podcast comes down to, then, is several intelligent hosts trying as hard as possible to avoid intelligent discussion in order to appeal to an audience that isn't listening. No one is listening to the NPR Politics Podcast to get takes on pop culture from those who were hired to discuss politics. At that point I'd rather listen to a genuine pop culture podcast, not some confused amalgam.",1
"Gave a Go, Then A No Go",01/29/2017,JSailor1,"Well, I listened to see how serious NPR would cover US politics. Only took two listens to confirm this podcast could / should be listed under MSNBC. This is just the same liberal group that hurls insults at the winning team instead of focusing where the Democrats should improve. So, good luck with that.",1
Great Podcast,01/29/2017,Btitlw,I listen every week. Great analysis from interesting people. Usually not biased too heavily in one direction.,5
Great podcast - lighthearted but informative,01/29/2017,Lord Voldewort,"I really enjoy this podcast! They are good reporters that you can trust and rely on who give out a lot of up-to-date information, but it's lighthearted and upbeat too so we don't have to all sink into despair under the trump administration. I only wish they would do daily episodes again, but then I'm not sure where they'd find the time to be actual reporters that way either, haha.",5
Love it!,01/15/2017,DShouse5,My favorite podcast...never miss it. Confession...I listen to some episodes more than once!,5
Trying to like it.,01/15/2017,Ktiamo,"Ron Elving is keeping me tuning in. The others are sometimes good, but please -- please stop complaining about working hard! You have a great job at a young age.

It's great to hear the staid voices I hear during various news programming be a bit less formal and more ""themselves."" Informative and intelligent - this is not just a news summary around politics, but smart analysis as well. Is it completely impartial? Maybe not completely, but it's not left leaning bias, it's intelligence bias.",5

Sliding downhill fast,01/19/2017,The Shooter McGavin,"Throughout the presidential campaigns and the primary and general election, I fell like the show was very mutual in presenting facts and not being politically biased.

Informative but oh so liberal,01/24/2017,Tim Penney,"Can't deny these people know their stuff but would love to hear a more middle of the road/objective approach. Not that I support trump in any way (or Hillary for that matter) but the liberal stance is always talked about as ""what could have been"" and the hosts liberal agenda always leaks through. Would love to hear the show be about what's happening in our country and to leave the agendas behind. If this stuck to that, it would be an easy 5 star review",1
The only way I can stand Politics,01/24/2017,nzahn1,The only way I can stand staying informed about politics is to listen to this podcast and the reporting from NPR news. I cringe every time I have to walk by a public TV showing CNN with shouting surrogates.,5

Fake News,01/13/2017,PGHgravy,If you want to listen to liberal radio where they talk about fake Russian hacking instead of actual news these dudes are for you.,3
Amazing!,01/13/2017,MBWI1984,"Very entertaining, insightful and detailed. Great work and thank you! Wish they were daily episodes.",5

Another Essential Politics Podcast,01/13/2017,BrynBehr,"I'm a politics podcast junkie, and NPR politics is definitely at the top of my list. Their coverage during the campain was fantastic, and I know that the same thoughtful, thorough analysis will continue on. I was thrilled to hear that they are planning on continuing the show past inauguration, this is a must follow for anyone who wants to stay informed in what's happening in Washington, and around the country!",5

THANK YOU!,01/14/2017,zhwilkins,"Hey y'all! I'm an American living abroad, so the amount of American news I get is limited compared to what I'm used to in America. This podcast not only helps me keep abreast of key events, but goes into enough depth that I'm able to discuss these events with friends and family back home. Thank you NPR Politics!",5
Calm and Reasoned Coverage,01/14/2017,Elecray7k,"The team at the NPR Politics Podcast have been my heroes for many months now. Instead of leaning on the anger and polemics that have defined American politics for the last 20 years (or 400 years, take your pick), the team speaks swiftly and knowledgably about the week's events. The hosts do a great job providing explanations and context when listeners need them most. And even when the news isn't so great, the hosts are clearly enjoying themselves. It's a gift.",5
Clear and concise,01/14/2017,Latherb123,This program does a great job explaining the week's political events in a way that I haven't heard anywhere else. The commentators are personable and knowledgeable. I enjoy it each week.,5
Too Late to Be Useful,01/14/2017,ClassicsBuff,"This podcast would probably be good for someone who does not follow the news closely and wants to catch up periodically. I find that by the time this podcast is aired, the topics discussed are old news and have been hashed out already by other sources. I believe this podcast would appeal to yournger people. In my opionion Ron Elving is a treasure and I would like to hear much more from him. His insights and his journalistic and historical knowledge are very impressive. I am also sorry that Sam Sanders has left the podcast. His enthusiasm was appealing.",3
Love the show,01/14/2017,Makeup gal,It keeps me informed in a balanced way - with a little bit of levity now and then. One of my must listen podcasts!,5

Informative and well thought,12/24/2016,destiny-morna,"I appreciate this podcast this election cycle and look forward to them covering the trump presidency. The demographic info is interesting and I appreciate the hosts measured and thoughtful analysis. This podcast feels more balanced and respectful than other political podcasts that seem to degenerate into shouting matches. Thank you for the knowledge and education you bring, at least to this listener.",5
Fair and balanced,12/24/2016,Ryks Schock,I love how this podcast covers most of the major political events in a fair and balanced way while not speaking down to the listener but providing context historical or otherwise.,5
They‚Äôll keep you sane,12/26/2016,Powerful story.,"It‚Äôs like going to a cocktail party with all your smartest friends. They make me think. They make me laugh. They make me feel like I have a basic understanding of what‚Äôs happening and why. Even better, they never devolve into name calling. They are combatting the disrespect and lack of civility that have come to characterize our political process with every podcast.",5
Offers a variety of perspectives,12/27/2016,Llynnmcd,"NPR has created a team of reporters who cover a broad spectrum of the political realm, allowing you to hear from topic experts regardless of the top stories of the week. They bring real news in a fun, informative way.",5
Great Podcast,12/29/2016,BigFan2239772,"Love the show. Love hearing legitimate, honest, fact based reporting. They are a voice of reason in a tumultuous time. Can't wait to hear what they have to say in 2017!",5

NPR meets Fox News,12/29/2016,173764ehsbd,"Although I find DJT repulsive, this podcast seems intent on stooping to that level of disgusting behavior. There is no objectivity on this show. Example: this podcast criticized Ted Cruz for quoting lines from the Princess Diaries. Another example: never any serious examination of HRC's flaws, just unoriginal obsession with criticizing everything DJT does or says. And the ""journalists"" routinely make lame jokes in a desperate attempt to sound cute. This podcast is just following Fox's lead.",1
Unfortunate Decline in Quality,12/30/2016,PasCalCPA,"Alas, I just unsubscribed after listening for more than a year. What used to be insightful analysis is now -- not so much. What could be a crisp 20 minute analysis is now typically a preachy, self-centered 45 minutes, with too many voices to distinguish among. I'd like a mainline NPR-like political podcast, but this has become something more like Fox and MSNBC. Too bad.",3
Over it,12/30/2016,Holly's D,"I have been listening for over a year. After much internal debate, I'm unsubscribing. I'll stick with the Takeaway and The Run Up. You bend over backwards to appear 'fair'. The irony is that facade itself becomes unfair. My final straw was listening to Sam Sanders and co. spend 3 minutes poo-pooing Obama's lack of ""grace"" while continually glossing over the enormous breaches of decorum, ethics, and decency in Trump. How much more should Obama bend over?? Sam, you have more venom for a pop star than you do the barbarian at the gate. I can't do it anymore. At some point, you will need to look back and analyze where you could have and should have been stronger in a fight against fascism instead of this mealy-mouthed, unctuous need to make equal comments out of unequal behavior. Grossed out. Turned off.",1
Very Sad,12/31/2016,Tdgoss,"Although I disagree with 98.2% of all npr opinions, content is typically well written and articulated. This show...no honesty, no diversity of thought, no critical thinking, no logic...otherwise first rate;).",1
Wonderful!,12/31/2016,Historylove,Great coverage. Thanks for all that you do!,5
Great show!,01/03/2017,Liz14jones,I love listen to the show on my way to work. I'm able to learn about what is going on in the world of politics while getting an overview of both sides opinions. Keep up the good work!,5

Unbiased,01/05/2017,Lynnette H,"I listened to this podcast all through the election process for unbiased news. Now, I find it even more important to listen to get a clear, concise understanding of what is really happening. I find that every other news source I read or listen to has some sort of bias. I truly enjoy the respect that the various commentators show for each other and the subject.",5
Informative and fun,01/05/2017,33tink,This show got me through the elections and I still need it.,5
Where are the politics?,01/06/2017,Plutopluteau,"I enjoyed this podcast for years, but it's taken a sharp decline since the election. While the outcome of the election reveals our urgent need for broader discussion of issues of rights, enfranchisement, and civil liberties, this podcast is doubling down on its daily headline fandom. Amusing enough chatter, but bad podcast for anyone interested in politics. Should be renamed ""Fun DC Ramblings"" or something like that.",2
Top notch pod,01/06/2017,Senor Cuidado,Recently discovered this podcast. Love the format and the personalities. Hate queso.,5
My most regularly listened to Podcast,01/07/2017,Jazzy_Fool,This is by far the podcast to which I am most loyal. Excellent reviews of recent political news in (I think) a nonpartisan manner. Excited for them to continue post-election.,5

Informative and entertaining,12/14/2016,Moriah12345,I love this podcast. I started listening to it because I just wanted more information about what was happening in our country during this election and they were very informative and did a great job of not being too slanted one way or another. Huge fan,5
Politics simply isn't fun any more,12/14/2016,sailchannelislands,"These guys were a great help getting through the election, even though they got it wrong. I'm counting on them to explain how the world might not come to an end that Democracy might survive.

Not reporting,12/16/2016,Nithster123,"This podcast is pretty much 1 hour rant of biased view of everything. If you want liberal bias listen to this. If you want actual news and reporting, look elsewhere.",1
Very slanted one way-very partisan,12/17/2016,beach_dood,"If you enjoy Bob Garfield's elitist attitude (on the media)and partisan politics, you've found your new home. NPR and all its programming is now on one person President TRUMP. Seems he (President TRUMP) could drop a fork at dinner and that would be a whole hour on so-called ""analyzing"" the dropped fork and how the American people will suffer for a dirty fork.",1
Why isn't rated lower?,12/18/2016,YourMomAndMe,this isn't the politics NPR USED to have. now they are just believing whatever major media says. there's no real research and actual analyzing. don't bother listening to this podcast anymore because they are just trying to get more appeal to the younger audiences.,1
A good podcast for your mom,12/18/2016,Alex from DC,"NPR politics podcast is a little more ""Regis and Cathy"" than what I think are better political podcasts: FiveThirtyEight and POLITICO Nerdcast.",3

"Vibrant, nuanced discussion",12/22/2016,Wagnearo,"I appreciate the professionalism and the playfulness of this podcast Whereas some reviewers seem a little huffy at the ""coffeehouse"" feel of the conversation, I really enjoy the sound of intelligent and informed people talking insightuflly about interesting and relevant topics, so you'll get no complaints from me! As an 8th grade Humanities teacher, this podcast has sometimes helped me understand specific topics more deeply, which has prooved useful when helping my students navigate this election and post-election season.",4
Helpful!,12/22/2016,Minor Groove,Informative and pithy summaries of the news each week.,4
#KeepCalmAndEducateYourself,12/23/2016,Neuvoxraiha,I stumbled onto this podcast about one week before the election and it's been a shining beacon of non partisan sanity for me.,5
"Love the show, didn't listen to fmr iteration",11/27/2016,JJ yay,"As a ""younger listener"" I really enjoy this show and constantly share it with friends, esp those who find Politics boring. They cover a wide range of stories relating to this election cycle; both informative and entertaining. after following this show for over a year I can say they have grown into a better show overall. I must agree with other reviewers who enjoy Ron Elving- he is great, more Ron please.",5
Fun and informative,11/28/2016,Katie in PHX,Really well done with extremely knowledgeable hosts,5
Thanks,11/30/2016,Fraggin' awesome,Really great content and style. I actually listen on overcast but love this podcast enough to jump over to iTunes just to help other people find this show. Thanks to them for all they do,5
"Informative, well done",11/30/2016,Librarian Lisa,"I especially appreciate the way audio clips are woven into the discussion. It's not just describing what was said or done, but letting us hear for ourselves. This is a great way to stay caught up with the news.",4
Sigh,12/02/2016,AdamFB,"After months of listening to this podcast, I can comfortably say that it is a mess. Dangerously milquetoast and equivocating, Sanders and company have a wishy-washiness, constantly pulling back from anything remotely hard-hitting. It is a disservice to listeners and a threat to the very nature of journalism. At a time when journalistic strength is more important than ever, the casual unfunny yuk-fest that the hosts perpetually descend into undermines any message therein, even if the message is simply supposed to be ""here's the truth."" Sanders's ""aw shucks"" mentality and his (faux?) naivete are increasingly unbearable, and glamorize a culture that keeps education at a distance. Ron Elving and 1 or 2 others are the only reason I kept coming back, but I am now done with these dishrags. And to the reporters on the podcast that may cover the White House, I pray that the tepid soup you are serving here is not indicative of the weakness with which you intend to cover the actual news.",1
Awesome !,12/02/2016,alonzocris,Very informative and fun! Love this podcast.,5
Great Way to Spend an Election Year,12/02/2016,ECH in Jax,"I had the pleasure to listen to ALL the episodes have to say that NPR brought sanity, insight, humor without setting aside the very serious issues, and balance reporting to a crazy and unpredictable political year.",5
Eleanor2016,12/03/2016,Eleanor2016,I love this show!!! Very in-depth commentary and always fascinating takes on the politics of today. I also enjoy the 538 politics podcast and enjoy listening to this show as a companion pod.,5
Excellent!,12/05/2016,Babysy,I listened to almost every episode over the past year and was very thankful for the no-BS approach to explaining what was going down.,5
Pretty solid podcast,12/05/2016,Jo Bones,I usually enjoy NPR politics but I think it needs more Ron Elving and less Sam Sanders. I'm sure all the folks on the podcast have strong political opinions but they usually do a good job of keeping them hidden... except for Sanders. His liberal bias comes through very strong. It's like watching Monday night football and having Troy Aikman openly cheering for the Cowboys. It's distracting. I would give this podcast a better rating without him onboard.,3
"Informal, informative, and essential",12/07/2016,stoobush,"A really fantastic news and roundtable. Provided essential daily coverage leading up to the 2016 Presidential Election. Informational and insightful with a relaxed, informal tone.",5
Journalistic Integrity found here.,12/07/2016,Jesse Edwards,"Hey y'all. Point blank, this podcast was my best source of information throughout the 2016 election cycle. The team does what NPR does best: provide intelligent explanation and analysis of the news, with respect to all comers and a desire to find the truth. I'm going to miss Asma and Sam a lot when they leave after the inauguration, but I trust the rest of the team to continue the excellent work that I and many others have come to expect from this podcast.",5

Gonna miss them,12/08/2016,Romulus bo peep,"This podcast has been a solid go to. It's more than entertaining, it's truly thought provoking. This team is funny, thoughtful, insightful, and inspiring.

I respect this group, would love to get a beer with them or just meet/talk to them and at the least I hope we get another pod from them!",5
Excellence,12/08/2016,Kakechik,It's the first show on politics that I really felt was not skewed one way or the other.,5

These are phenomenal journalists,12/08/2016,communistkid,Even with the stress of the election I was mourning come Nov 8 with the lack of daily episodes. A great listen for anyone across the political spectrum. Sad to see Asma and Sam go.,5
Love this podcast!,12/09/2016,MidwestMomofthree,I love this podcast!!! I love everyone on it equally for their unique individual perspectives on the topics.

Woe to the future,11/21/2016,Lolan7,"If this is what now passes as NPR-quality political discourse, the Millennials should go back to school. Face it you guys, you're not Bill Maher, despite how funny you find yourselves. You're snarky, with shallow insight and offer no more than regurgitation of the headlines.

Intellectually void,11/21/2016,titfos,"I loved NPR for most of life, but something has changed. They have abandoned truth in favor of the mission of the ""Control-left"". At this point they are a danger to free speech.",1
Enteraining and informative,11/21/2016,inaword,"I really admire the podcasts that happen at midnight to 3am to give us timely information for current events. It's been a wild year in politics, so the podcast was helpful to separate the news from the noise.",5
Divisive,11/22/2016,Lacowart,Just started listening after the 2016 election. First thing they do is start labeling conservatives as white nationalists. I am a white conservative. I am however very much against white nationalists. But somehow it is deemed appropriate to label me such. This feels like a blatant manipulation of the media and I have had enough of it. If this is what NPR feel is appropriate I will be stopping my donations in the coming weeks. We've all had enough divisiveness.,1
Learned a lot about the electoral process,11/22/2016,Voyy34,"I love, love, love the NPR Politics podcast.

helps makes sense of current events,11/24/2016,tippering,"I like how this podcast lets us hear from multiple reporters with different relationships to the politics, including younger voices. However, I hope they will consider a new opening theme song in the wake of the 2016 election!

I was, however, very pleased when I found this podcast earlier this year. No, it is definitely not the same as It's All Politics and I do miss Ron Elving and Ken Rudin together. However, this new group of reporters (including Ron Elving, which I was psyched about) do have insight to offer and it's nice that they switch things up each episode.",5

Not even close to Accurate,11/11/2016,johnston827,"NPR Politice, it's hard to say if they are propagandist or just completely ignorant about what they are talking about. Uses multiple host to all agree with eachother to attempt to boost their false credibility. Yeah, if you are wanting to get confirmation bias as a liberal in not know what's really going on, this would be for you. However, if you are looking for journalist, move along, you wont find them hear. This podcast seeks to drown out negative information about Democrats and even gets their talking points from Democrat opperatives Twitter feed. If you listen to this, you would probably be surprised by the vary predictable victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 election and think it was an upset when in reality anyone paying attention knew he was clearly going to win months before the election. It your goal is to be well informed, this is not the podcast you want to listen to. NPR only reinforces the eco chamber that had so many ignorant on what was really going on.

"Informative, unbiased & interesting!",11/16/2016,NPRer4Lfe2016!,"I have been listening to this podcast for about 6 months now and rarely ever miss an episode. The hosts are knowledgeable and, in my opinion, try to provide an unbiased source of what's going on in the political sphere. Of course, we are all human and have our own perspectives but the hosts maintain a professionalism about their reporting that is unlike many other news outlets. They speak directly and deal in facts. If you're looking for a great political podcast to add to your queue, this is it.",5
Vital!,11/16/2016,TTUScout,I don't know if this is the perfect place to express this but I really hope NPR keeps making this podcast. It's exactly what NPR should be doing right now. I really appreciate all the different voices especially Asma and Sam. Please give them more ways to get their voices on the air.,5
Love it,11/16/2016,remixin_it,Can't get better than the NPR politics team. And we'll need them now more than ever. Courage to the brave. x,5
Got me through this election cycle,11/07/2016,WinkOnce,"I recently got into the world of following politics and this is by far my favorite podcast. It‚Äôs informative and down to earth. The smart dinner party like vibe to the entire crew is easy to digest. I‚Äôve genuinely learned more about our political climate since I‚Äôve started listening, but more importantly it‚Äôs changed how I interact with government. I feel a sense of civic engagement that I didn‚Äôt before. I have sat through this entire election cycle listening to this podcast, and I find that I‚Äôm not bitter or burned out by it. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a pretty impressive feat. A fantastic listen for any commute, thanks Ya‚Äôll.",5
Downright amazing,11/07/2016,usarca2001,"No question the best political show, of any medium. They've kept me sane during the election and were the quickest most informative way to get caught up quickly.",5
Great Politics Round-table!,11/08/2016,Schubesss,"I've been with the NPR Politics for the past year and I have loved every minute. My poor friends are stuck listening to me constantly saying ""I was listening to the NPR Politics Podcast and...""",5
generally pretty good,11/08/2016,a4theroad,"Have several political podcasts to try to get a mix of viewpoints to listen to on the commute: Shield and Brooks PBS Newshour, Townhall Review, and NPR Politics Podcast. The NPR team brings quite a bit more humor and personal experiences of the campaign trail than the other shows which is appreciated given how dismal this campaign season has been. They make a good effort to do exposition on items less familar to non-political news hounds. Some of the political (left-center) perspective shows through on occasion. On the whole a good show! Keep it going.",4
Love Love Love,11/08/2016,Shushamo,"Why this show isn't on twice a day, I'll never understand! I love the focus, the feel, and the panelists. It reminds me of happy hours when I worked on campaigns. A passionate group of people discussing what they love. Can't wait to see how this evolves post election.",5
"Fresh, upbeat take on the political news of the week",11/08/2016,Batgirl2011,"This podcast is quite entertaining and informative. I enjoy the rapport among the journalists and it seems they've now hit their stride. I follow a lot of political news and I find that I do get a different, fresh perspective on the news of the day. Good job!",5
Keep me in the loop,11/08/2016,Out of loop,"So I'm a college freshmen and have really enjoyed this podcast as it has told me what is going on in the political world. I don't get to watch much news, so I rely on this podcast and a few others. When I have had political discussions I often find myself referencing this podcast! Thanks for the wonderful updates and relevant news!",5
Highly recommend this podcast!,11/09/2016,Lwgeorge,Highly recommend this podcast!,5
"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place",11/09/2016,Indebted to your service,"This podcast has been my solace and comfort. Its intent seems to bring the listener into the newsroom, allowing me to glimpse and feel included in the discussion about the issues I am reading about. They bring a sense of family and personality to news that, to me, has been dark and when you are able to laugh and smile while listening to the news you are hopefully more likely to be openminded. Thanks politics podcast, for all your work.",5
Informative,11/09/2016,CoachBrackin,Look forward to listening everyday- especially during this election. Interested to see where y'all go now that it's over. Sometimes some in the group gets a bit too narrow minded but I don't find it hard to look beyond this. I appreciate all the hard work that you do!,5
They layed an egg,11/09/2016,Road_Work,"I liked them right up through the election, then realized they were just as mesmerized by the Snake charmer Trump as MSNBC, and other news outlet. They need to figure out why they so badly called this election and explain it clearly before I can consider them a serious news source. Until then, they are just a silly bunch, and perhaps they should go out and start their music career.",2
NPR has lowered a high bar it usually sets for itself,11/09/2016,PeteCO19,"Sam is unbearable. He talks over others, silly 'pop culture' references, ""y'all"" grates on the ear drums and the ""reporting"" of his feelings is unprofessional. It has a Fox and Friends feel that is just plain awful. Give me Elving, Horesely, Liasson, Keith, Montanaro and Khalid for serious, objective and useful information. Please do better.",1
"Missed the mark on Trump, but good none the less",11/09/2016,stutes,"This is a podcast that I don't miss, and even force my kids to listen to",5

I was a little late to catching on (finding it) but I've been addicted to the podcast ever since my first listen.",5
NPR has to be better,11/10/2016,Radiojunkie73,"I'm sure Mr. Sanders offers NPR value in some capacity but he is not well suited for this program. He consistently talks over his colleagues and uses ""I feel.."" and ""My question"" or ""My thing"" as if real journalism is somehow about him. When the access Hollywood tape was news, Sam actually said,"" I'm going to let the women talk but first I want to say.."". Truly awful reporting for someone who claims to ""campaign reporter"". His pop culture references take away from the seriousnees of the topic. The use of ""Y'all"" sets an unprofessional tone to the content and is head shakingly frustrating for something produced by NPR. Ron Elving, Mara Liasson, Scott Horsely, Dominico Montanaro and Asmed Khalid are the best this podcast has to offer. Please NPR, demand better of your productions!",1
horrible,11/10/2016,the dude‚Ä¶.,it's not a political podcast it's two people's opinion on left wing liberal politics....,1

A podcast for all people,11/11/2016,melpr11,"Love love love this podcast, have been addicted since the conventions. Always refreshing even during the onslaught of election news.

Good info,11/01/2016,Jpooooo12345674315,"Great for current events elaboration and insight, but comically biased at times.",4
Biased political podcast,11/01/2016,wmjones79,"I gave this podcast a fair trial of unbiased listening over the course of 5 podcasts hoping to find an unbiased source of political news. I've come to the conclusion that NPR's political views are clearly leaning to the left. And that's fine, that's their prerogative...it's just a very biased view.",1
Love it!,11/01/2016,TheBarretts,I look forward to each episode. I think they do a fantastic job of breaking down the issues and filling in the gaps of the rhetoric. They give clarity to a very hazy election. Thanks y'all!,5

Fantastic podcast,11/03/2016,poliscijunkie,Love this podcast! They are by far the most moderate and balanced political news source that I have heard.,5
A breath of good air,11/03/2016,icarboncopy,Love this podcast. The crew is great and of course it's NPR so don't expect any praises for the Republican Party or conservative ideals. But they do present both sides of the parties.,5

Civil politics,11/04/2016,Juliakimj,"I would like to recommend the NPR politics podcast. They keep me informed without raising my blood pressure. They discuss current topics without name calling.

Should have known.,11/04/2016,hank the cowdog,Playing up Trump's political incorrectness. Downplaying Clinton's criminality. At least they admitted it's a 10 on 1 game for Trump. Not sure if they included themselves and the rest of the media in that.,1
Definitely add this to your list!,11/04/2016,Lichen,An extremely well produced and researched pod cast that provides well thought through discussions about what's going on in our world.,5
Best of its Kind,11/05/2016,TTH17Y,This podcast has been extremely for me as first time voter to put the election in perspective. It covers both sides equally so you get a feel of what's really going on outside of the regular coverage. Above all they break it down in a way that I actually understand that it educational and fun! Love the podcast and hope they keep up the good work!,5
One of the best parts of my week,11/06/2016,Colin 33,"Clear, thoughtful, and informative.",5
Educational,11/06/2016,SophiasChoice,"I love hearing the podcast - I have learned so much about the process and not having been schooled in this country, it has been helpful to know why US elections are done the way they are. I enjoy hearing about history and the nuanced analyses behind the political strategies the candidates involved this year employed, if any! At times, I wondered if any of the campaign managers had any idea how to drive the boats in this race. Thanks for making the election more fun.",4
"Ron Elving, my hero",10/27/2016,MissFitPhoto,"I am so very happy I stumbled upon this podcast! I'm am not a political science major and I understand most of what is be covered by the news, but sometimes I need it explained fast and in detail and that‚Äôs what they do here! They break everything down quick and in depth while trying to cover what needs to be covered...not just the fluff. The NPR crew (Also known as Vocalness lol a fun joke they all have) make you feel like you are a part of the conversation, not just listening. From Sam Sanders to Domenico to Tamara Keith and everyone‚Äôs favorite Ron Elving (who‚Äôs my hero lol), to name a few, the crew at NPR Politics are well informed and very good at what they do.",5
Killin it,10/27/2016,brc4444,You guys are killing it leading up to the election! So many different things happening every day and you make it easy to follow. Never get rid of Ron!,5

I üíñ Ron & Vocalness,10/28/2016,zingzang,"Fantastic podcast, absolutely adore each host and their extensive and in depth knowledge on American politics.

Used to be a Reliable Podcast,10/28/2016,stawjo,"I used to listen to every episode of this podcast as it was a great source for relavant information and provided analysis of issues of the day/week. This has turned into a biased discussion, all favoring Hilary Clinton and her campaign. I was hoping at least one media source could remain unbiased, but unfortunately NPR did not live up to that expectation, I am disappointed.",1
Best way to keep up to date about the election!,10/28/2016,Mo2188,I look forward to this podcast every week. Thanks y'all :),5
"Insufferable at times, but Elving and Liaisson rock it",10/29/2016,mrchiplambert,"Depending on the configuration of the day's hosts, this podcast's quality and content careens from thoughtful and engaging political analysis to eye rolling insipidness that causes me to simply delete the episode. The talk of one host's Twitter feed and Vocalness is kind of embarrassing. Perhaps this could be split into more than one show...maybe a podcast with just the seasoned pros in the room. Ron Elving and Mara Liaisson rock and I love their ability to place current events in a broader context.",3
Great!,10/29/2016,Ifubnasty,A good mix of old school and new school journalists covering all things politics each week. They have been working their butts off for this election. I do like that they do a impromptu podcast whenever anything news worthy happens during the week. Love Ron Elving,5
Awesome,10/30/2016,VTgreenboy,"Not only a great explanation of all things election and politics, but the reporters have fun and make it interesting.",5
"An informative, refreshing, and fun listen",10/30/2016,Nurse Keith,"As a professional podcaster, I appreciate a well-executed podcast. While some listeners use words like ""sophomoric"" and ""overly cute"", I use words like informative, upbeat, positive, and entertaining to describe NPR Politics. In an election year when vileness and negativity hold sway, an upbeat, hip, and funny podcast about politics is a relief and an island of sanity in a political world gone haywire. There are plenty of political podcasts that go deeper for wonks and nerds; if NPR Politics doesn't do it for you, feel free to shop around and allow us ""laypeople"" to enjoy ourselves with this smart and informal team who bring some humor back to the fray. All political humor doesn't just have to be on late-night TV.",5
Good stuff,10/30/2016,"etcetera,etcetera","It's a bit to horse race focused (as my brother pointed out), and a bit light on policy (like trump), but they record shows often and keep me up to date. Great personalities and specialists too.",4
Too much speculation,10/30/2016,Avidia,Speculates on public response. Goes overboard in trying to appear balanced even when this doesn't appear consistent with most other reporting. 538 podcast is better.,2
Awesome Sauce,10/30/2016,Fluco Government Teacher,"NPR Politics podcast opened the door for me to the wonderful world of podcasts. For that alone, I love this show. I teach 12th grade Government and the podcasts help me interpret the political news for my students. The show is informative and topical. Given the sprinkling of negative reviews, it is not for everyone. I urge you to take a listen for yourself.",5
Favorite Politics Podcasts,10/31/2016,Wheezy82,I love that the hosts are knowledgeable and informative without resorting to mean spirited bashing of either party. They also have a lot of fun. #vocalness,5
More Ron Elving,10/31/2016,ActionFan1,Enjoy the podcast but it needs gravitas. More Elving -- less Sanders. I have faith everyone on the show will continue to grow into their roles. But faith and patience are not in the same supply.,3
Fair Coverage in a crazy election,10/31/2016,Gershuni8,"Well covered stories on this nutty election, especially since most other coverage is so biased.",5

Vocalness fans UNITE,11/01/2016,tavo_rbls,"Hey y'all, this group is my go-to for current news and updates on the rollercoaster that this political season has turned out to be. The contributors are informative and clever, and are not afraid to get personal about the topics at hand.

Hands up for anyone who believes that Vocalness can be the healing force that this country will need.",5
Hillary worshippers,10/24/2016,Brunin-g,Don't confuse me for what I'm not. I'm far left independent . I'm also ashamed if took me this long to unsub.,1
It's growing increasingly more insufferable,10/24/2016,Anthony in NC,"This podcast is wearing thin. The millennial make-up of the usual panel is dripping with saccharin. Vocalness isn't funny. Beyonce isn't a politician. There is no need to reference either in every episode. The phrase ""I feel like"" should be eliminated from the banter. ""Aw?"" Oh my goodness, just stop. Please have Ron Elving and Mara Liasson on more often. Actually, have just the two of them and it would probably be an excellent podcast.",2
Makes me smile,10/25/2016,Batgirl558,"I love the banter and the education.
The hosts obviously respect each other and have a comfortable, knowledgeable report.",5
Constantly refreshing for new episodes,10/25/2016,Words2yoMutha,"I find myself constantly refreshing my feed in hopes of finding a surprise episode. I find this podcast to be incredibly informative. My husband and I love listening together but sometimes I can't wait for him and I listen on my own because I can't wait to get an analysis from the podcast crew. I've learned so much about politics. What I like most, and I know it's weird, is the listener mail from people in other countries. Politics podcast crew I hope you read this review and know that you are wonderful and providing a great service to listeners. I've read some of the other reviews and think maybe they didn't stick with you long enough to get you. Keep up the great work!",5
Always tell you how it is,10/25/2016,Nicole E RL,I love this podcast because they tell you exactly what you would want to know without any confusion. They break it down in a way that you can understand it and develop your own opinion. They also seem to have fun doing it and try to keep it light in a time when things seem to be so serious.,5

Like the variety of topics and frequency of episodes,10/26/2016,mari_hendrix,"This podcast has been an essential source of news for the past few months during this unusual and - let's be real - totally crazy election season. Tamara Keith, Asma Khalid and Domenico Montanaro are particularly knowledgeable, helpful and entertaining, and unlike some of the other reviewers, I appreciate the cheerfulness of their banter and the camaraderie of the correspondents. For a long time, I listened to Slate's Political Gabfest but had to unsubscribe because I could no longer tolerate how negative, self-serving, combative and rude David Plotz is. The NPR correspondents on this show cover very difficult topics in a professional and personal way, and listening to this show is a joy.",5

Great podcast from great people,10/26/2016,alltheseusernamesaretaken,The NPR Politics podcast is one of my mainstay podcasts during this political season.

A little dissapointed,10/26/2016,Skatergirl126,"Many aspects of this podcast are great, such as the topics discussed and the quality of the hosts. I consider myself as an indepenant with moderate views leaning a little more the the right and so what I am looking for is a politics podcast that has discussions on current events in politics from different angles. I thought that National Public Radio would give me views from the right, left, and center with thoughtful, intelligent, and curtious debates. There are views from the left and center but no right leaning opinions which i think would be a great addition not only to hear their views but to see were both sides can come to an agreemant on the important issues. I believe a big part of the reason that republicans and democrats have such animosity is because people today have so many options today that people just go to places they can listen to their own views instead of hearing what the other side have to say as well.",3

Thoughtful and Generous,10/18/2016,Lielhari,"While the cheerful and uplifting theme music belies the nature of this year‚Äôs presidential election for many of us, the NPR Politics Podcast team are nevertheless refreshingly generous and thoughtful with their analysis, insights, and explanations of the political scene.

Podcast is excellent,10/20/2016,@kyleinphoenix,"Excellent podcast and is a the top of my listening list. Only critique from the past few episodes regarding the third debate is it is "" University of Nevada Las Vegas"" not ""University of Nevada in Las Vegas"" small critique from a past Running Rebel! Keep up the great podcast",5
I hate Politics,10/20/2016,Tawnyleona,"...but I love this podcast. They are informed and fact check, they explain everything (even a noob like me can understand), and they present everything in a relaxed, stress-free environment. I never watch the debates anymore; I just load up the podcast afterward and hear the key points.",5
Not balanced,10/20/2016,JadieG,I was hoping for a balanced discussion with good insight. This was neither of these. Extremely sophomoric and lacked little substance.,1
Love the group!,10/20/2016,WaltSays,Fun and informative! Great group of knowledgeable journalists in a slightly informal round table setting. Definitely not stale and void of oxygen like the traditional political news.,5
Reliably on-point,10/16/2016,Jezz A Belle,These are the professional journalists of our time; they practice a high standard of ethics and prove that smart reporting can be enjoyable listening.,5

Listener,10/16/2016,Justtheintern,It's easy to listen to because they all seem to really enjoy talking to each other and doing what they do. It's not terribly in depth or nuanced but a good way for me to stay up to speed on politics without a TV. I love Ron!!,5

Can't let go,10/16/2016,Hriket,Well researched. Casual storytelling format. Trustworthy. I think they try not to take sides at much as they can. Definitely non-partisan,5
New listener,10/17/2016,Sarah wants a date option,"I haven't listened to this broadcast until recently, so I don't know what I'm missing out on - but, I like the show and the analysis. They have interesting incites and perspectives, but I wouldn't qualify it as hard-hitting in-depth journalism. I am enjoying it, though.",5
Fun!,10/17/2016,Bluebird no. 3,"I love NPR politics! Best place to go for quick political updates, and I especially love that the commentators don't yell at each other!",5
Can‚Äôt Stop. Won‚Äôt Stop,10/17/2016,Delizly,"NPR Politics Pod has made me the most informed voter I could probably ever be this election cycle. The crew is making sense of the strange and complicated situations that are coming out of this election. I love that they also say, ‚Äúif you only listen to us, you‚Äôre doing your new wrong‚Äù. They encourage people to be wise intakers of the news and I appreciate that. ALSO, they are hilarious. They bring a light-heartenedness to what could be a very dark season. Can‚Äôt wait for Vocalness to hit the ear waves though. Love the podcast! Thanks for all you do.",5
My favorite podcast,10/17/2016,Jess Turtle,I'm totally an NPR junkie so it's no surprise I love this podcast. Every time a new episode show up in my feed I get excited. I've been listening to the podcast for a few months now and enjoy what every member of the team brings to their coverage of the political events. Their diversity and expierence means you hear a lot a view points from those of millenials to our elders. Can't wait for the Vocalness album!,5
Love it!,10/17/2016,NCLPhilly,"Entertaining, informative, unbiased - a rare point of light in 2016's dismal election season.",5

A little skewed.,10/17/2016,Fed up 58354255366,"Overall a pretty good show. They advertise themselves as unbiased, but that is not the case for all commentators.
I am a truly independent millennial voter who wants a podcast that just delivers facts.",3
Total bias.,10/17/2016,knick86,"I love how they open a podcast by saying ""appear toy we aren't covering trump enough so this episode is dedicated to him"". The entire 55 minutes was pure bashing on him and if at all they spoke about Hillary, it is how she is the best candidate for president. TOTAL BIAS!...ps I'm not voting for either candidate",1

Awesome!,10/14/2016,MaWest26,Great work from NPR as always!,5
Disappointing,10/14/2016,Dr. Smoothrod,"This is a very shallow political analysis during a year where an independent/undecided audience is eager for healthy speculation. This podcast made me realize npr is far more left of center than I'd ever imagined. If the constant giggling and cutesy/middle school joking doesn't turn you off, then the bland generic news analysis will.",1
Tireless,10/14/2016,yea....,"Hey y'all, this podcast has been a constant source of consistent and what seems to be fair coverage of this marathon race to the white house. Love listening to you guys' banter - graph nerds unite!",5
Refreshing,10/14/2016,ConchisErin,"During a campaign that gets increasingly darker and dirtier by the day, listening to this podcast is one of the few ways I consume election news that doesn't raise my blood pressure. The Politics team doesn't shy away from discussing the dark and dirty aspects of the campaign, but do so with a... levity? Tone of camaraderie? Whatever it is, it's refreshing.",5

Fun & Real Political Analysis,10/15/2016,Bigarn72,"This podcast just provides great political analysis. The analysis is balanced, looking closely at both sides. The extent possible, equal amounts of time are given to both sides of a political contest. The combination of poll analysis, on-the-road campaign reporting, understanding of the issues, and emotional intelligence provided by Susan Davis, Ron Elving, Domenico Montanaro, and Sam Sanders is an excellent one for a podcast. This is the podcast for understanding US politics!",5
What about talking about the libertarian candidate?,10/15/2016,JennyJiffy,"The hosts are intelligent, engaging but I have to question them as there is absolutely no mention of our third party candidate Gary Johnson. While the hosts say in essence they are tired about talking about scandals why don't they talk about policies? America is sick of talking about scandal after scandal - why not talk about something else's then? It's nauseating how many minutes of air time NPR gives to Trump, even one of the hosts said ""I can't wait until it's over"" Talk about something else then! We have a third party! Open your eyes. America is just as frustrated as the hosts.",3
Great Perspectives,10/15/2016,Long time NPR Junkie,"I love smart political discussions. And here's nothing better than real journalists who's livelyhood and passions are based on getting to the innerworkings of our political system. While I miss Ken Rudin, this group has something he and Ron Elving did not - multi-generational perspective. Keep up the fascinating discussions and fact checking!",5
Thoughtful and unbiased,10/15/2016,as1876,"Great show, listen now!",5

"Poor analysis, decent overview",10/15/2016,davidjtemple,"If you miss a debate or other political event and want to hear a recap of what everybody else is saying, this podcast will do a good job getting you caught up. But if you're a follower of politics who wants analysis, you'll be disappointed by this podcast. They rarely say anything controversial. And rarely debate a topic. It's basically a rehash of the media's response to the week's political news.",3
Not to be missed!,10/15/2016,Brownal,"I have become a political junkie this year, and this podcast is just what I need. Very informative, timely, and unbiased.",5

Wish I was in the room,10/14/2016,Hstewzxc,I love listening to these folks. Now I know that Dominico is the journalist's name and not a political think tank/ research group. Oops. Thanks!,5
Great!!,10/14/2016,DaniJoanAK,"I think this is an excellent conversational and informative podcast. Some people have complained that this is dumbed down for listeners - I have to disagree. We can't get all our news from one source. In order for them to cover so many topics in a short period of time, they can't delve to the depths of each issue - I think they do a great job of casting a wide net in their coverage, so that I know what to go chase down to read in depth in the WSJ, NYT, and other outlets later.",5
"Best political analysis, esp. during the election season",10/14/2016,CloudedDreaming,"I just started listening to the NPR Politics podcast during the 2016 RNC and DNC, and have been hooked ever since. The NPR Politics team provides level-headed, reasonable analysis in an unreasonable time in politics, and they've really been putting in the hours during the election season with special episodes as scandals occur. The best part: they somehow manage to both enlighten me with their analysis and calm me down a bit.",5
Best political podcas!,10/14/2016,Training cook,I absolutely love listening to every podcast that NPR comes out with!! Must listen for the informed!!!!,5
Great fun nice and early.,10/14/2016,Gzg4158,"The best mornings for me these days are the mornings when the NPR Politics folks have stayed up late the night before assembling a new podcast. I get up early and go for a walk every day, and nothing puts greater pep in my step than the snappy march that is their theme song. Love all of the participants. They're all good (although I must confess to a bit of a crush on Sam). They are all guiding me through this terrible Season of Trump, helping me to make sense of it.",5
Great,10/14/2016,Srysly,Great podcast but can't stand the ads with music. So jarring and unnatural for the podcast style.,3
Love your podcast,10/14/2016,Eppguy,I really look forward to your podcast each week. Ya'all are my favorites. Keep up the good work!!,5
It has went down hill..,10/14/2016,Travis Asher,I started listening to this pod during the primaries and absolutely loved it! Recently I have found myself listening to about 15 minutes of an episode before I delete it. It feels like the hosts are trying to sway the listeners to the democratic side... And I really with they would talk more about the third party options. How are people supposed to hear about other options if the media doesn't talk about them... Looking forward to listening again after the elections are over!,3
Making The Election Bearable,10/14/2016,Lursa27,"Love listening to this ‚Äî it's one of my favorite podcasts. Listening to the analysis, and behind-the-scenes of political reporting is highly interesting, but what makes it a must-listen for me is the back and forth of the reporters. They seem to have an easy rapport and banter, and their quick and intelligent takes on the election cycle, its demographics, and breaking news have made it easier to bear the often cringe-worthy moments of this election cycle, while keeping up with it. Looking forward to hearing the post-election coverage as well.",5
Pretty Good,10/14/2016,Terrance Whilloughby,"I like this podcast a lot, though it could have some more depth and be a little more entertaining.",3
How I'm staying informed in 2016,10/14/2016,EddsWat,"This is an informal political podcast of which I really cannot get enough. I find the crew to be measured, informed, informative and entertaining.

Great show to keep you up to date!,10/14/2016,Nannerpuddin1019,I have always tried to somewhat keep up on the ongoings of politics but without having time to watch the news in the morning I felt like I couldn't ever really know what's going on. I don't have the patience to spend hours reading articles that are usually outdated by the time I got to them....then I found this podcast. With the 2016 election looming I knew I needed to be more informed but needed something that peaked my interest and had different points of views. I know that I have so much to learn about the politics going on in our country but this has been a great jumping off point and I look forward to listening to each new episode! Love the crew and all of their personalities! Keep up the good work!,5

Essential Political Guide,10/14/2016,snodgram,NPR politics podcast is a refreshing balanced group of voices of reason. It's a great behind the curtain look of campaign reporting.

I didn't listen very often after the reboot but that changed as the 2016 presidential election has ramped up. This group is more than capable.

And I thought I would have to suffer through it, because politics frustrate me all too often, and I get tired of it quickly. I am elated to say that this podcast is the farthest thing from painful. This podcast gives me life. The reporters try to explore different perspectives on the issues, and work really hard to give you the facts without being dry and robotic.

For when I want something fun,10/12/2016,Cdriff,"Definitely not the hardest hitting political podcast out there, but provides some good context and a heavy dose of fun to this season's insane political proceedings. I recommend The New York Times's The Run Up for deeper (though not as expansive) looks that really dig into the social and political issues around the 2016 election, and FiveThirtyEight for wonkier talk, but also fun and enlightening discussion.

I wanted to be informed and make my decision about who to vote for based on accurate, unbiased information. I really appreciate the lightness that they bring to really heavy topics.

1/3 truth 2/3 articulate spin,10/11/2016,telephone,"I use to love listening to NPR. Honest, down to earth host, great place to get honest news, so I thought. I woke up to the horrible realization that NPR will twist the truth so articulately that we are hypnotized and lead to think a crime or injustice has not happened. For example the injustice of the Dakota pipeline, the Bernie Sanders Campaign, Wikileaks of Hillary Clintons Wall Street transcripts. I love the sweet voices of NPR but I am saddened by the lack of humanity for the Dakota pipeline that NPR host have shown or not shown. Listen to NPR and be aware of the twist and turns they report. You will be awakened to the horrific truth that NPR is apart of the unjust machine.",1

The variety of panelists provide a great perspective and insights on the campaign and historical precedents.

Great Podcast,10/10/2016,Pole locker,"I love this Podcast. However, I feel like Sam Sanders doesn't provide any great insight to the Podcast.

Normalized,10/10/2016,GDinTally,This podcast is frustrating because the hosts treat the 2016 election as a horse race. They consistently normalize Trump and his positions by failing to point out his many deceptions and outright lies - instead they put them on the same footing as Hillary's distortions. Coverage may be pleasant but it often ends up being superficial,1

Thanks to the hosts for doing such a wonderful job.",5
Every Episode a Xmas Present,10/10/2016,NotAWit,"This group of individuals delivers political news with grace and intelligence. More than that, they are fun! I'll put it another way. Ya know how you have those friends that go to expensive gastropubs and swirl wine and everyone at the table talks because they love the sound of their own voice? Then you have those friends that you grab your favorite drink with, split a deep dish, and talk because you enjoy each other's conversations? THAT is this podcast; educated, intelligent, and relaxed.

Invaluable in 2016 campaign,10/10/2016,rayofchuck,"The NPR Politics team is the antidote to the divisiveness and sensationalism so many other media outlets have embodied throughout this tumultos election.

Constant disappointment,10/11/2016,Nebrides,"This podcast rarely goes beyond the run of the mill media echo chamber orthodoxy. Ron Elving is mildly charming, but in a very pedantic way, you can get that same flavor with more substance from the Slate gabfest pod. Domingo Montanaro knows his stuff, but you can get much better analysis from the run up and 538. Asma Khalid is awesome and a natural treasure, but there's not enough of her to justify slogging through all the other nonsense. I have been waiting for Sam Sanders to say something insightful for months. What a tool.",3

"Worst Political Podcast, ever!",10/08/2016,Real Journalist,"This podcast is frustratingly biased. Sam Sanders represents everything wrong with the emasculated American male. This isn't real journalism but rather a group of faux journalist who prattle on about their social justice warrior issues. As a liberal, this Podcast is everything wrong with the regressive left.",1
Really annoying politics coverage.,10/09/2016,Pengwuin18,"In general it is frustrating to hear the false equivalency of the coverage of trump and Clinton.

A Worthy Successor to It's All Politics,10/09/2016,Neil Gussman,"I wore a black armband three years ago when It's All Politics ended its long run. This podcast is lots of fun a big cast of experts with complimentary areas of expertise. The ""Can't Let It Go"" segment is a great wrap-up.",5
Sanders aversion,10/10/2016,Tobias in Chicago,It's his voice and his analysis that lack substance. I'd love this podcast if Sanders' voice wasn't prohibitively cloying. So sorry NPR. I'm a mega fan otherwise.,1

Shallow and cutesy,10/05/2016,bergerman,"I really wanted to like this podcast. I have given it a long try and it has not improved. I'm done. The core group of commentators seem vague, somewhat uninformed, very light on facts, mostly trying to entertain each other but not the listener. I expect more from NPR. Such a disappointment, especially during this crazy election.",1
This is the best political podcast out there,10/05/2016,Julmagana,These guys do an amazing job at summing up the ever-changing political atmosphere.

"That ""other"" Hilary",10/06/2016,SheDupree,"The absolute hands-down best way to get caught up on the political stuff that has gone on during the week. Better than having to cobble together reports from minute by minute reporting, these guys have seen it all, and give you the best of the best, and what you need to know in a very sane, straight-forward, no-nonsense way. I started listening during this election cycle because I personally cannot stand to hear equal time given to Donald Trump and his crazy ideas. This way I can keep on top of his crazy ideas, without having to hear about them ad nauseum, and still feel like an informed voter, trying to do my best as a voting citizen in this democratic republic. HIGHLY recommended.",5

I enjoy the light tone of it -- even as people seek to dislike the podcast for that very reason! Politics takes itself so seriously on a daily basis that it's nice to hear it discussed in a free, easy manner. Especially in a climate of divisiveness, disagreement, and social media arguments, it's nice to hear people have a conversation about politics while still cracking jokes and laughing at the absurdity of it all. Also, Sam Sanders is the man; I want to be his friend.",5

This podcast isn't meant to be like listening to the news, it's purpose is to be more conversational and I enjoy that. I also like that they encourage you to get your information from multiple sources as part of a healthy news diet. This podcast is my favorite course. And I may have developed a crush on Sam Sanders.

After hearing Sam Sanders on Pop Culture Happy Hour and LOVING him, I decided why not. Thank goodness I did. What a great treatment of the circus currently going on in American politics. Thorough, insightful, yet light-hearted with just the right amount of sarcasm. This pop cast is all I want to hear with regard to election coverage. Many, many thanks to the NPR team. You're the best.",5
Look forward to this cast every week!,10/02/2016,MeMeMeAndMore,Sam Sanders and the gang keep me informed on what's going on and I love it!

Expert analysis from NPRs heaviest political hitters,10/03/2016,PrinevilleChaCha,"My first political pod and still probably favorite. Love the extra attention to demographics and historical context.

Biased,10/05/2016,Edgemx,This podcast is very PRO Hillary. Giving half the facts and only supporting Hillary. Very sad. Thought it was going to be a good informative podcast.

One of my favorites!,09/29/2016,Podcast junkie7,"As a person of color, I appreciate the racially diverse panel. There's also a balance between men and women--that's so important when discussing reactions of political events. The panel never paints any issue with a broad brush--everything is nuanced. I'm also a huge fan of Planet Money and 538. If you like those, you should like this one, too!",5
Idiotic,09/29/2016,PinkLadyGala,"This podcast surprised me. Although it's produced by NPR and I presumed it would be left leaning, I wasn't expecting it to be overtly so. For example, in The First Presidential Debate episode, Ron Elving says (minutes 16-17) that he's amazed that Republicans have been able to be elected in communities of color by spreading ""A Republican message""--implying that the Republican platform is implicitly racist. They also honed in on all of the erronous facts that Donald Trump cited during the debate, but failed to call out ""let's look at the facts"" Hillary for also living in her own reality, as she claimed that Russian Intelligence hacked into the Democratic e-mails, a claim that's obviously been suggested but really is conspiratorial.",1
Politics with 538 since XKCD,09/29/2016,Erich.V,"I've been checking in with Nate Silver for politics coverage ever since the 2008 election. From his blog, to the NYTimes, to ESPN. I remember exactly where I was when I first listened to the Beta version of the podcast on What's the Point? I appreciate their way of telling stories where data drives the narrative rather than just decorates it. I appreciate how cleanly they are willing to say they were wrong about a predictive mistake and investigate their own biases. Also Clare Malone not only has great reporting and analysis, I love her wry interjections that are not just for laughs but at times add a perfect amount of pushback.",5

Don't the rest of you WANT young voters to learn?,09/21/2016,jessalyn_luree,"Many of the reviews on here balk at the show for being ""sophomoric"" and a transparent ploy at looping in young listeners to the political discussion. My response: isn't that a good thing? First time voters and young listeners have to begin building their political intelligence somewhere and many other podcasts and new sources require so much base knowledge that there is no entrance point for newbies. By throwing in quick (just seconds long!) explanations about context, they're broadening their content to reach those beginners who are eager to join the discussion.",5
"Not informative, unbiased, or entertaining.",09/21/2016,Birakon,Barely bailed bias towards Hillary. Not a Trump supporter but come on...you might as well change the name to the anti trump podcast. I wonder if Thur could crawl any further up into Hillary Clinton at this point.,1

"These ""journalists"" seem to lack perspective.",09/23/2016,Chicot28,"As a person of color listening to this podcast, I have to say that the only perspective they seem to promote is that of middle aged white baby boomers. Hiring a racially diverse group to basically spout out the same nonsense that appeals to upper middle class white baby boomers does not change this. These reporters sound like they are living in a DC press bubble and seem to be handed quotes straight from the HRC campaign (without fact checking any of it). At times the podcast can sound like straight up propaganda. You guys are doing a disservice to your audience hoping to keep your access to HRC and the powerful in DC. There is real economic strife in this country and all we hear about is the horse race. The couple of reporters of color in this podcast have missed so many opportunities to educate the listeners, preferring instead to promote a particular candidate. Sam Sanders should just go work for the Clinton campaign because he straight up sounds like he is getting paid by them (BTW, completely ignoring why millennials of color are not as enthusiastic about Clinton). Asma Khalid is the only saving grace of this podcast. This is specially true of her on the ground reporting segments where she talks to real people. Please try to do more reporting like Ms. Khalid and please NPR try to find young journalists of color who are doing good work and not just that one kid who went to school with your son at Harvard. I have resorted to listening to BBC and The Guardian podcasts dealing with U.S elections. Your content can sound amusingly superficial at times and that would be great if our current political situation was not as grave as it is. What you are missing seems to be diversity of perspectives. Half of the time most of your hosts/guests agree on most topics and those are the same things the DC press Corp agrees on and the same thing CNN and MSNBC agree on making you just part of the ""mainstream media"" NPR purports to be morally above. Nobody is buying this, you guys have Goldman Sachs advertising on NPR.",1

Too informal; Biased sometimes,09/14/2016,Anil KC,"This is an okay podcasts for all the politics that's happening in this presidential election. The voices are amazing; intoxicating some of them. But the content and flow of conversation is too informal. It feels like group teenagers talking with each other with nonsense high school drama.

DC Politics Gossip,09/16/2016,FOODSWINGS,"I've listened to this podcast fairly faithfully through the primaries and now into the general and I mostly like it. It's like sitting in a bar in DC with a group of knowledgable folks who get together to gossip about politics. Real analysis comes and goes, but there is a lot of speculation and a constant rehashing of topics that other media outlets have long dismissed. Sam Sanders particularly loves to bring up Clinton-related gossip like email, Benghazi, and health ""scandals"", a lazy journalistic trick that got old during the primaries and makes me want to skip ahead in the podcast now.",3
Best thing about the 2016 election,09/16/2016,SMCRichards,"This is hands-down my favorite podcast, I recommend it to everyone! A great way to stay up to date on the election and other political news- the rotating panel of NPR politics journalists are informed and charismatic.",5

Propaganda masquerading as journalism,09/09/2016,RenBop9020,"I initially felt that my preference for Sanders over Clinton was the reason I interpreted this podcast as biased towards Clinton. Now, it's clear NPR Politics is all in for Clinton. I don't care for either candidate, but they clearly do. Podcast ignores unflattering stories about Clinton, as well as third party candidates, and primarily focuses on threat/foibles of Trump. Save your time, just read DNC talking points instead.",2

Has grown on me,09/10/2016,agr3446,At first I was a little turned off by the endless seemingly senseless banter. I realize NPR needs to attract younger listeners and I'm all for that. However in the beginning I thought some of the programs were too much fluff.,4
Island of Sanity,09/11/2016,ReadDeep,"This podcast has become an island of sanity in this election. It's informal and they don't reach their arms way into the clockwork of the political machine, but to me that's a feature not a bug (if you want that, there are other podcasts and articles that provide it).",5
Ron Elving Saves This Podcast,09/11/2016,rocketsummer,I honestly only listen to this podcast for the chance to hear Ron Elving's always excellent political analysis (and the occassional inclusion of Mara Liasson). The rest of the podcast sounds like a group of teenagers sitting in a Starbucks trying to sound cute as they discuss topics that they don't have deep expertise in. Would prefer to hear more seasoned and experienced political analysts' and reporters' voices leading this podcast.,3
Fair and Educational,09/11/2016,Rob45674,This pod cast is great for keeping current on the election.,5
Mainstream Chat,09/11/2016,pshelleyg,"Armchair perceptions representing a rather suburban frame of reference. One commentator was asked about the high point of the weekend, only to share details about a wonderful wedding in the family. I wanted to hear perceptive political insights, not a discussion that descended into mundane nonsense. NPR should be more not less. With my membership, I in fact expect more. Everyone is so self congratulatory and comfortable with one another in their complete mediocrity. I stopped listening. Too many more penetrating and perceptive commentaries out there.",2
Politics Made Dynamic!,09/11/2016,Chris MarkerMorse,"NPR politics is, with out a doubt, the most consistently entertaining, informative, engaging and humorous political podcast I have found. My family have been listening each week since April, and we all have become big fans. It is at once analytical and also without obvious bias and baggage- these reporters know their story as well as their history. A highlight of my listening week.",5
Virtually no new thoughts,09/12/2016,KaLGio,"Terrible political podcast. More journalists sitting around decrying this political season and complaining about how hard their job is. There is no effort to find stories about people who care deeply and are enthusiastic, particularly about Clinton. The only stories are stories that underscore preconceived narrative created by the media",1
USA politics distilled in a fun way,09/12/2016,DSingmaster,"If you are a news junkie, it enhances your knowledge. If you are interested in what's going on in politics but don't have time, this group distills recent events into an entertaining conversation. Ron Elving provides insight and history to put it all into perspective.",5
A Fun Way to Follow Politics,09/12/2016,makemonkeydance,"I love this podcast. I love the fact that I can follow what's happening in the election without the urge to continuously bash my head against a wall. These guys cover weekly news events and policy points thoroughly and thoughtfully, while also managing to keep it light and fun. I really enjoy NPR's traditional reporting, but this is a very engaging variation. I will agree with other reveiwers in that it is liberal leaning... but I am too.",5
Ron and Domenico need their own show,09/12/2016,Jacobshahin,"Honestly the only bright spots of the show.

This is too often watered down for an audience that doesn't exist.",2

Can't Let it Go,09/03/2016,boomstacy22,"One of my top three listens each week. Not any hardcore journalism here, but that's not why I'm listening. I listen for the humanity and humor they are putting out there--Can't Let it Go is my fave.",5
Love it!,09/03/2016,Kendracukes,"Great podcast! I've been listening since the beginning, and I never miss an episode.",5
Great,09/03/2016,Alexfromnc,Great take on politics,5
Too much silliness at times,09/03/2016,LEC dancer,"I like the content, but at times, there is too much inane silliness, particularly when Tamara Keith is there. I like humor, and don't mind a few inanities, but sometimes, it seems like the first 3 or 4 minutes are just plain stupid. A little less silliness would be appreciated.",3
Great way to keep up with the elections without all the chatter,09/03/2016,Alabamian newshound,"With the political season in full swing and with non-stop coverage on the cable news and otherwise, this is a great way to keep up without getting worn out with the non stop news cycle.",5
Fun weekly review,09/04/2016,Emishred,"In reading the other reviews, seems as though there's a lot of listeners who don't like change or the younger generation. I find this show refreshing and appreciate that the journalists share some of themselves. It's not meant to be straight up news and analysis which is abundant elsewhere.",5
Thanks NPR,09/04/2016,Albert Hertz,Nice weekly or more political summary of US politics. I am going to try to stop reading my US political news feeds and get what I need in that area here. Saturation requires some change and I think I need that.,5
Political Guilty Pleasure,09/05/2016,Lewaters,"While this is not the most hard hitting new podcast, it was not meant to be. As advertised it is how friends would discuss politics together. I thoroughly enjoy this podcast every week. Vocalness should do a West Coast tour!!",5
Political rhetoric you don't hate,09/05/2016,Megmccleary,"I love this podcast, especially Sam Sanders (hey Sam!). I have stopped watching TV news due to the repetitive, biased sensational political stories. This podcast is refreshing, conversational, entertaining and easily digestible. Keep up the good work!",5
good podcast,09/05/2016,idaho sheila,Informative as well as entertaining. It has been great to hear from Ron Elving and his political wisdom again.,5
"Fantastic, balanced, entertaining!",09/05/2016,sorensown,"I've become a huge fan of this podcast simply because, well, it's a lot of fun. Yes, I learn a ton and love the analysis, but Sam Sanders is a maestro, taking some serious content and making it personal--for everyone!",5
Big fan,09/06/2016,Brtyu7775457,Its an enertaining way to get updated for any politics junkies out there.,5
Best Politics Show ever,09/06/2016,Tim1566,I've been listening to this podcast since the beginning every week and figured it was finally time to leave a rating. I love this show and enjoy all the hosts. Sam Sanders is very entertaining and throws in pop culture references from time to time. As a republican I find this show very fair and balanced and it fairly represents the issues on both sides. Great job everyone!,5
Packed with Fun and News!,09/06/2016,Jewell313,I would have given 5 yet I wanted to get the attention of the group. I appreciate the honesty of everyone on the show. I would like to hear equal coverage of Hillary. I know DT is hogging the air wave because Negativity sales. Yet I don't want to hear all that all the time. Overall the show has given me a new appreciation for Political News.,4

Informal and informative,09/07/2016,Unlikable characters,"I look forward to this podcast weekly. It's a lighthearted take on political news, more like overhearing a conversation between friends. Entertaining and informative.",5
Yes,09/07/2016,57333,Possibly my favorite podcast of all time; would love to see it continue even after the elections wraps up.,5
Helps me digest the news,09/08/2016,mgrondin,I really look forward to this podcast each week. It always helps me sort out the news and understand the importance and significance of different events. Plus it is often funny and always very conversational. The rapport between the participants is delightful. It's one of my favorite things to listen to when I work out.,5
"Great for me, maybe not for everyone",09/08/2016,johnspam,This has been a great way for me to keep up with politics this year now that I don't have a TV. It's been rough due to it being election season but I'm excited for after the election is over and they can commit more time to other issues. I would recommend this to younger folks like me because it's politics in a very digestible amount of time and the format is easily accessible.,4
Monday and Thursday are my favorite days,09/08/2016,Chocoloco47,"My favorite podcast! I look forward to Mondays and Thursday's like I do the weekend! For someone who doesn't have loads of time to devote to digesting national political news, this crew does a great job summarizing and analyzing the events of the past week.

Domenico Review,08/31/2016,Grippin the Gryphon,"Politics is dirty. Domenico is totally correct. I came here to review him, but as everyone knows he is completely indistinguishable from Scott. I wanted to rate Domenico a 3, Scott a 3, Mara and Ron each a 5, Sam a 3.5, Tam a 4, Danielle a 4, Sarah... Nina Totenberg has been on this podcast. Transitive property is in play so I'm going with a 5.",5
Haven't missed an episode,08/31/2016,Ariana23,I love this podcast! Especially during this campaign season the discussions are always on point and informative. Best group of political reporters out there!,5
Fantastic,08/31/2016,Brusseldaniel,My only complaint is that it isn't daily.,5
Great wrap up of this crazy presidential race,09/01/2016,Matt1906,"While it doesn't have the whacky Ken Rubin and his back and forth with Elving from ""It's All Politics,"" the cast now, of Asma, Sam, Dominico, and the rest are great. More episodes, please!",5

biased and uninsightful,09/02/2016,jstrangexoxostl,"I'm a liberal but dismayed by the biased reporting in this show.

The reporters here often just regurgitate tired tropes instead of offering any real insight or analysis. The focus is mainly on how these individual reporters FEEL about some particular news story.",1

Best Political Podcast,09/02/2016,AngAlbright,"Great show! It's a good mix of news, commentary, and humor.",5
A Favorite,09/02/2016,Bing15,"I am an avid podcast listener and started listening to NPR Politics earlier this summer because of this insane election season, and it has become one of my favorites. I look forward to each weekly episode and love the ad hoc episodes (especially the ones about musicals and politics and food and politics). The topics are timely and covered excellently (but that's to be expected withh NPR) but the best part is the casual and witty repartee with the correspondents and reporters. They make these episodes so funny and entertaining. I did not expect that from NPR! Politics on TV are too much about talking heads and people screaming past each other. Here the participants enjoy their discussion, even when they don't all agree, and genuinely seem to like and respect each other. A refreshing change from the usual political coverage. Keep up the good work!",5
Great Political Podcast,09/03/2016,MachaTrinity,"Content is always current and interesting. In the ever changing world of US election politics, this podcast provides 'context.' Its tone is informative yet not dreary or condensendating. This Boomer gives a five star rating.",5

I LOVE Sam Sanders,09/03/2016,Mwaite08,"I love Sam Sanders and the rest of the crew that put together the NPR Politics Podcast! The weekly approximately 45 minutes podcast covers all things politics in a down to earth, easy to understand, relatable, and witty way. I look forward to hearing these amazingly journalists' take on all the major political news stories. You don't feel like you are listening to the news more like you are listening to a group of smart friends discuss the world of politics. They all clearly have a passion for journalism and politics. Bravo!",5
5 stars for Domenico,08/26/2016,20sCentrist,"5 star rating for Domenico, thank you for never sugar coating American politics. Also, 5 stars for this podcast in general, it contains unbiased updates on political events.",5
Great!,08/26/2016,Sukalski A,I love these ladies and gentlemen!,5
Mostly annoying banter,08/26/2016,EleanorH,"At least Ron Elving is on the show. Besides him the yucking it up style is so annoying. I think mature minded people are interested in politics, can your show please reflect that maturity?",2

"Very informative, insightful",08/27/2016,Mustafar,I listen to this every time there's an update. It is very informative and often insightful. I enjoy the perspectives of the contributors. Highly recommended.,5
Insightful,08/27/2016,FarSuperior,Helps make sense of this insane world we leave in.,5
One of the best,08/28/2016,Funguy180,This is by far one of my favorite podcasts. It is extremely informative and entertaining. I can't say enough positive things about this podcast. Just listen to it and you'll understand.,5
Overall,08/28/2016,Lindavey,"I always enjoy this podcast. Some of the harsh reviewers must not listen to tv coverage of this campaign. The insights I hear from the NPR Politics team are often obvious, but so are the candidates. I enjoy the bantering and camaraderie. This is the one podcast I always listen to.",5
Great Podcast,08/28/2016,millionaurefor,Really spectacular podcast that really keeps me in touch with what is happening.,5
Entertaining and informative,08/28/2016,Wildcat3514,I recently discovered this podcast through NPR One and am really enjoying it. Fun tone while covering serious subjects.,4
Hillary can do no wrong.,08/28/2016,selnychef,"Unfortunately this group of commentators are hell bent on kissing HRC's butt. Granted, Trumps a train wreck, but a Hillary has a walkin closet full of skeletons.",1
Love this Podcast!,08/29/2016,TJGoldwing,"I love this podcast! I generally do not enjoy politics and find it difficult to stay focused when watching television news or reading about politics. This podcast keeps me entertained and makes it all interesting for me. I have talked about this podcast so much that my political junkie husband has even started listening to it. Thank you, NPR!",5
Snarky and low on information,08/29/2016,ProfSpice,"I listend to this for a couple of months, with decreasing enjoyment. Mostly an oportunity for some of the reporters to give their opinions - spoiler alert, they hate Trump and dislike Clinton. How about telling me something I don't know? I too miss Ron Elving and Ken Rudin's discussions, from which I did usually learn something.",2
continuing to listen but. . .,08/29/2016,jlindley02,Some shows better than others. Would be good to stop the giggling and cuteness.,3
Terrific counterpoint to on-air coverage,08/29/2016,Iggy's Little Friend,"This seems almost cathartic in delivery. Serious reporters discussing political campaigns and topics in an informal way. As a serious (wife would say pathologically) election year news junkie, I've completely fallen for this round table format for discussing issues and candidates, especially since they're not constrained to a 2-3 minute summary. It's like an interesting discussion between well-read wonks at a dinner party, which is probably why you can almost hear the relief in their voices as they get outside the spin zone.",5
Thoughtful and engaging!,08/30/2016,Raquel Shelby,Love the show!,5
Best podcast out there!,08/21/2016,eeka6,I've been listening to the NPR politics podcast for almost one year now and I am in love. This podcast has been so informative throughout the election process and I feel much more informed after listening to this podcast rather than reading junk on the internet. Sam Sanders and Tamara Keith slay every week. I going to be sad after the election because that means I won't be able to listen to this show each week. Keep up the great work!,5
Excellent Podcast,08/22/2016,Dduerr,I look forward to this podcast most of all.,5
The best. Period.,08/22/2016,Florida recycler,"I could listen to this podcast every day and never get tired of or bored with it. It's insightful, witty, and both serious and silly. (Vocalness, anyone?) I listen to a lot of politics podcasts. This one is by far the best.",5
Can't Miss An Episode,08/22/2016,I<3AW,"I've listened to every episode of NPR Politics and now feel that if I miss it, I missed a critical element of the weekly news. Thanks for giving me the weekly roundups but also the irregular reviews; i.e. Musicals and Politics, which was my favorite. Terrific show!!!",5
Ron Elving has been kidnapped!,08/23/2016,BeefShanks,"NPR: Ron Elving has been kidnapped by snarky novices. He's trying to talk to them, but they can't hear over their own insufferable Can't Let Go's. Please save Ron and give him back his well-deserved show.",1
Used to love NPR...,08/23/2016,Devidoodles,"Someone else wrote that Fox News was the end of good and unbiased news coverage, but NPR politics is truly no better. It is biased and is not devoid of opinion on the candidates without even giving opinion on ALL of them. Another news source stuck in the duopoly of the political system. The media could make this country great but for some reason, the media no longer trusts the average citizen to make an informed decision on facts. Media like NPR Politics attempts to sway the listener, but in doing so, they've either polarized people on issues that are truly debatable to a reasonable human...or drive them elsewhere for news. Unfortunately, we are losing places to turn to. **Please bring the old NPR politics back where you inform and allow us to make our own decisions based on fact, NOT your individual sentiments in the matter.**",1
Not what I expect NPR podcasts to be,08/23/2016,sfcddm1,This is a bunch of kids attempting to make jokes. What is this a high school show? Not entertaining at all.,1
A little disappointed,08/23/2016,Dbeebe2,I really wanted a place to go for a quick update on the political scene....and now the podcast has turned into schtick with you guys seemingly entertaining each other.....and immaturely I might add. It would be nice if you get back to reporting on the political scene.,2
My favorite podcast,08/23/2016,Jaymemax,Makes politics fun. Nuff said.,5
Great Show,08/23/2016,Keithslu,It's like hanging out drinking coffee and having a civil conversation about Politics... Highly recommend.,5
"Shallow, inane waste of time",08/23/2016,Aconcernedlistener,"The show is essentially 30 minutes of tired Trump jokes by 4 uninteresting, untalented hacks desperately trying to be funny or surface an original thought. Politics for people who are into memes and tumblr. For an interesting take try the New York Times podcast ""the run up""",1
Nerdgasm all the time.,08/24/2016,Sugarplum fairy face,This podcast is my new god.,5
Be nice to Ron!!!,08/24/2016,Tears streaming,"Love the podcast but there's no need to be condescending to Ron just because he is older. He has a perspective that you 30 year olds cannot bring to the table. He may not understand some of your references and this podcast may be directed towards millennials like me, however Rons generation is one that has had much influence on our nation and you should treat him with RESPECT!!!!",5
Hilarious and insightful,08/25/2016,Madeinwisco,This is my favorite podcast! It's funny but also well informed and interesting. I love Sam Sanders and Ron Elving especially together!,5
Blatantly Democratic,08/25/2016,Woah1256734890,Funny and interesting but with strong leanings toward Democrats. Not really news...more like advertising.,3
Great gateway podcast,08/25/2016,HaayFromOaklandCA,"I excitedly await new episodes! I've never really been excited about politics until this podcast - it gives pretty thorough, accessible coverage with a lot of levity. Sounds like it may not be exactly what some political die-hards want; that's cool, you do you. I'll keep tuning in and loving it because I'm hooked. Keep up the great work Sam, Tam, Ron & team!",5
Great Team,08/25/2016,richnfudge,First don't see the option to only rate Domenico Montanaro.. just kidding. Anyway. It's a great diverse team with experienced reporters mixed with fresh voices. A nice mix of detailed fact checked coverage and funny Can't Let It Goes. I look forward to every episode.,5
"Love Ron Elving (yes, I also miss Ken Rudin)",08/26/2016,jwachter,"A worthy addition to a crowded field. (I also love Slate, Vox, New Yorker and 538.)

I'm particularly thrilled to hear Ron Elving back in fine form. I love his savvy and experience.",4
Bias is too obvious,08/26/2016,Lifeofblisse,"Sam Sanders is the worst. He has been quoted ""I know we're suppose to be non-bias but, *proceeds to be heavily bias and in favor of the left*""",1

Favorite,08/15/2016,Pbsfanforever,My favorite podcast on politics. Love it when there's a surprise extra! Thanks!!!,5
Very in right now,08/16/2016,Amylovespods,I love this podcast. I feel like the hosts really pay attention to pop culture in addition to politics which i find important because the two are so intertwined right now. I think the do a better job reaching the college age-group than a few other politics podcasts i listen to,5
Love the podcast,08/16/2016,Aria1982,I like the hosts a lot and because I listen to this podcast I now listen to NPR on the radio all the time!! Give us more episodes!!!,5
Look forward to each one,08/16/2016,Mambaitaliana,"Concise, to the point, more balanced than I would have thought possible. The musical episode was a treat, and the ""Can't Let It Go"" segments provide an informality that is enjoyable. Our household has put a moratorium on all network TV because of the election (that has been going on for almost two years now!). This podcast provides enough of the bare basics to keep us informed without the awful angry and indignant hangover we get from alternate coverage. THANK YOU!!!!",5
Sometimes interesting; somewhat self-indulgent comment,08/16/2016,jdexe,"Too much casual just-about-us talk among young NPR correspondents and editors, who ignore redirects by Ron Elving when he appears. Trust the old guy, kids, and move on to a topic, rather than making your 2nd, 3rd, or 4th personal aside.",2
Obama‚Äôs Vacation,08/16/2016,PocketPets,"I listened to your podcast. Always impressed by NPR, but was immediately turned off by the snide remark about Obama taking a vacation.",1

NPR the slightly liberal podcast,08/17/2016,Mericantactical99,Entertaining leans a bit liberal but hits the big points of what happened over the week. Sometimes I wish it was more in depth but that's not what it's supposed to be.,5
One of the most balanced podcasts out there,08/18/2016,Whiskey man4679,"I feel like we can get caught in the echo chamber if we're not careful. I think they do a gret job keeping the discussion balanced, even during one of the most polarized political races in recent memory.",5
Hope It Continues Past the Election!,08/20/2016,SandyCohen930,"Since they started this up a few months ago, I have been grateful for another thoughtful weekly overview of major political events. Sure, during the primaries and campaign season it's been complete madness - but the team makes it fun to track. And while some reviewers have criticized the hosts for letting some ""bias"" slip through, I think we need to acknowledge that it's hard for any reasonable journalist to take Trump seriously.",5
Completely unbalanced,08/20/2016,Runninghokie,"They present some good information, but their bias seeps through on everything. NPR should try to work to make this show more balanced.",2
Love!,08/20/2016,Jenrichvt,Great weekly recap of all things crazy/politics. The hosts speak in an intelligent manner yet they are entertaining enough hold my attention.,5
Good podcast,08/20/2016,Kml9703,"Keeps me up to date on the political happenings, but only mainly the election right now. Interested to see what this podcast will be like after the election.",5
Awesome Show!,08/21/2016,smilingradish,"Easy to understand for someone who doesn't know much about politics like me, funny and to the point, AND I feel as if they try be unbiased and look at the issues from different angles. Love it!",5
Big letdown this election season,08/21/2016,Stagmania,"I was initially very excited to find this podcast as the 2016 presidential primary was winding down. Featuring a rotating panel of bright, informed and interesting reporters, it gave a quick but thorough overview of each week in the election cycle, and t was funny too! As we've moved into the general election, however, I can't ignore the obvious and irresponsible effort to normalize Trump and treat his campaign with kid gloves, while simultaneously holding Clinton and her campaign to a much higher level of scrutiny. In recent weeks, they've gone so far as to ""interpret"" Trump's words for him to downplay his missteps, and engaged in outright speculation on mistakes Clinton might have made that there is no actual evidence for. I'm not sure if this is straight up bias against Clinton or simply a misguided attempt at ""balance"", but it has seriously diminished the integrity of this news organization in my eyes. They've lost me as a listener, and I can only hope their audience is not relying on them as a sole source of information during this critically important election.",2
A great listen to recap the week,08/21/2016,Jdvanmetre,Love the chat and informality of it.,5
Thoughtful comments,08/21/2016,Cbv1234560,"I love how these people comment and analyze political situations and events. The anchors enjoy it so much, that you will enjoy the ride with them while getting informed in a short time.",5
"So, like, disappointing.",08/08/2016,Kbizzle9,"I am a young, avid NPR listener and I was excited to listen to this podcast. It is, however, unbearable. I understand that the medium might suggest the need for a more informal tone, but the speakers are charmless and worse, patently unfunny. I'm no linguist prude, but would it, like, be possible, like, if, like, the speakers didn't sound like high school, like, freshmen?",1
Fun and easy to listen to,08/08/2016,txnyc25,Am loving this podcast...the team complements each other so well,5
Adds a dimension to already great reporting,08/08/2016,CarrieMRochester,"I'm 40 years old and have been listening to NPR for as long as I can remember... while my parents cooked dinner growing up, in their cars and now in my own home and car and office. And in the gym I load up my Ipod with this podcast. Not only is this podcast as insightful, thoughtful, intriguing and detailed as the regular NPR reporting, but it's so great to get to see more of the personalities of the reporters whose names are as familiar to me as my friends are. It's wonderful to hear their banter, wittiness, and perspectives and get to know more of their personalities and styles. It has made me enjoy their reporting on ATC and Morning Edition even more. I love the podcast. Your daily convention quicktakes were great and I'm really hopeful the podcast will continue even after Nov 8th.",5
Addicted,08/09/2016,Shillansky,Torn between love and terror of NPR Politics as we approach the election.,5
Sam Sanders,08/09/2016,akhelvig,Huge fan of the podcast. Not a huge fan of Sam Sanders not liking Cuban sandwiches.,5
Beautiful,08/09/2016,Julianddd,Incredible reporting. I want to be these guys someday.,5
Informative & fun,08/09/2016,Cmtlang,I loved their convention coverage and I'm still enjoying it post-convention. They have a great tone.,5
Political recaps and discussions I've come to depend on.,08/09/2016,erath.ac,"The structure of this podcast took a little getting used to for me, but now every time there is big political news I find myself looking for a quick take on my drive home. The weekly roundup has become an essential part of my weekly routine.",5
Great political podcasts,08/10/2016,AF630,Great recaps and analysis! I enjoy listening to the team discuss important issues and banter with one another. One poignant moment I remember was Sam Sanders' words on the Orlando shooting. Keep up the great work!,5
So great,08/10/2016,countchapula,"This is a great show that delves into current events with a conversational, modern tone. Huge fan.",5
It's a winner.,08/10/2016,Amandla4,"The old NPR Political podcast was awesome. This is different and equally awesome. You are engaging, informative and enjoyable. I also really appreciate the daily check-ins at the Conventions!",5
Excellent,08/11/2016,GM2929,Enjoy this podcast very much!,5
Suffers a bit from youth and inexperience,08/11/2016,criticusmaior,"Ron Elvig is the star here, and overall the podcast is quite good, but the youth and inexperience of some members of the team holds them back. They just don't have the depth of knowledge and history they need to really make this great.",4
Lighter political podcast,08/11/2016,gretelup,"This is a light, fun podcast that feels like an informal meeting of smart liberal friends chatting over coffee. I enjoy it, but it's a little slanted towards the left, and it's not as wonky as its predecessor, ""It's all Politics,"" which I greatly miss.",4
Great political podcast,08/11/2016,CSBoga**,I wish they did more podcasts a week. This is a great podcast!,5
great conversations on politics,08/12/2016,lucyelf137,"The podcast team offers fantastic insight into current political events, providing context and background. The conversations are fun and at times informal, revealing the personalities behind the voices on the team.",5
"Please, someone, but a muzzle on Sam Sanders",08/12/2016,BoulderTrip,"The program has pretty good content. I've been listening for several months, but am on the verge of stopping. The primary problem is Sam Sanders and his need to constantly interrupt and step on his colleagues points. For some reason, Sam seems to believe they're not making their points correctly and only his interruptions and amplifications will make the information digestible. Some of his points might be worthwhile to make - after his colleague has finished speaking. Tamara Keith does a bit of this too, but she can't hold a candle to Sam's rate of interruption and talkovers. What a breath of fresh air the August 1st and August 11th podcasts were - no Sam Sanders interruptions! Going forward I think I will turn off the automatic download for this podcast and only download when Sam Sanders is on vacation.",4
Subscribe Now,08/14/2016,AKStop,"Yes yes yes. I love this podcast. I never understood the importance of trusting journalists until I started listening to thus. I trust what they say is true. They strive to be unbiased. I am not a journalist so I am biased. When they discuss points of view contrary to mine, I cringe internally. However I LOVE it because it's good for me to hear the other side plus it is more proof to me they are presenting all sides of the argument and withholding their bias. I really respect them plus they are funny and intelligent.",5
Mostly great!,08/14/2016,Jaideep Sen,Sam and Asma are superstars!,4
Never miss it,08/14/2016,Bennybobobo,I never miss an episode and I find myself planning my days around hearing the latest episode. Completely invaluable in such and important year.,5
Always waiting for another episode,08/05/2016,21nehas,Love it! Love Sam Sanders!,5
Excellent Podcast,08/05/2016,FlumeToSplume,This is a great podcast for anyone interested in a both broad and concise take on the current political situation. It's especially great for following this tumultuous election of 2016!,5
Unbearably flip,08/06/2016,lwm65,"I am disappointed. This is like overhearing a bunch of old, somewhat inarticulate and tipsy friends in a conversation at a coffee shop. Little more than a jokey rehash of what most listeners already know from reading the newspaper. But again, they have to fill up the minutes and have little interesting to say. They must have a low estimation of their audience, but they could at least skip the sound effects and in-group referances to the political past.",2
Love this informal politics recap,08/06/2016,Angelstar260,I really enjoy this podcast. The podcast is geared towards younger people in the electorate. Instead of staunch political analysis includes more coffee talk review of politics with journalism and fact checking mixed in. It's a refreshing and enjoying take on the insanity that is our current political climate without the anger and overt undertones of division politics most shows have mixed in.,5
Just great,08/06/2016,Nanne123,"Just discovered this gem of a podcast. Love love love it.
It is very informative in a funny and interesting way.",5
"Smart, funny news roundup",08/06/2016,EmilyS1985,"I usually can't bear to listen to chatty, conversational podcasts, but this one is skillfully produced, with minimal pointless banter. It's a conversation among smart, knowledgeable people. It doesn't get into deep political analysis, but it's a useful and entertaining news roundup.",4
Very Informative,08/06/2016,ktw1313,"As someone who is trying to become more informed about politics, this podcast is great!",5
"If this isn't on your list, it should be.",08/06/2016,Pixelriffic,"This is the most enjoyable and informative media offering of any sort that I have encountered. If it's not on your list, it should be.",5
This election cycle,08/06/2016,Foogy,"Was the perfect time to start this podcast.
Everything has been so crazy it's nice to listen to this team break it down. Plus the team diverse(race, gender, age, etc), and that brings interesting perspectives to the conversation.",5
A pity,08/07/2016,Mphelps06,"At present, no insight or adult conversation. If you want to hear young pundits with something to say, head over to fivethirtyeight. If you're involved in this podcast, step it up. You're clearly better than this.",1
Fantastic,08/07/2016,RadioAddct,Great podcast,5
GWalklin,08/07/2016,gcwaz,"A great program. Group commentary that melds together smoothly and cooperatively. No easy feat. Informative, insightful, and entertaining.",5
"So ""neutral"" it's political",08/08/2016,gregmerfy,"Hosts are so afraid of appearing to have that mythical NPR liberal bias that doesn't actually exist they overcompensate to the point of being bland at best, inadvertent conservative shills at worst. A good example was in their description of Mariana Trump as having ""slayed"" her speech at the RNC, only mentioning the possibility of plagiarism as an afterthought.",1
Good stuff!,08/08/2016,Summitraz,"Fun show, worth a listen.",4
Great podcast,08/08/2016,Rms108,Informative and fun. I'm not heavily into politics and feel that this show provides a great summary of the week's political occurrences in a light hearted manner.,5
Mr.,08/08/2016,Tielu,"News can be fun. Politics are made interesting as well as profound in this podcast. I listen to every episode,and laugh with it. Thanks, NPR!",5
Almost,08/08/2016,JudyGlitterPad,"I have enjoyed listening to this digest of political news each podcast since the Republican National Convention, and have this observation. I'm wondering if you are trying to get a young audience by a) singing theme songs and b) saying ""like"" a hundred times per episode? I'm older and truly curious to know if this is a targeted effort, and are millennials really responsive to same? My guess is most of us, of any age, are already NPR listeners. Is inextricable really a word so unusual you have to challenge Ron to spell it and use it in a sentence? Give us a little more credit, please. Overall I like the content and analysis, just would like it to have a bit more gravitas. Thanks for being open to my perspective.",4
Great news source!,08/08/2016,scmgames2,Mainly because I've been listening for a while now and I can't see them leaning any which way so there's bearly if any bias,5
Great podcast,08/08/2016,Whitforbrains,"I look forward to this podcast every week! I'm a news junkie and the informal yet informative feel of this podcast is like I'm hanging out and discussing interesting political news with intelligent, witty friends. Highly recommend!",5
I think it's ok,08/08/2016,ALS04,For a podcast about politics that is supposed to cover both parties with unbiased lens I found it to be just so so.,3
"Thoughtful, funny, smart",07/31/2016,lw90631,"I don't know how I would get through this election without this podcast. They hit all the key points, examine the pertinent issues, and raise excellent questions. They also seem to really enjoy themselves, too. It's like chatting with that group of super smart, witty, political junkie friends you wish you had. Keep up the great work!",5
love it,08/01/2016,katharinejohnson,I absolutely love this podcast. I love how they talk to each other and how they talk about the different things going on in the political realm of our world. It‚Äôs been particularly great for following this insane campaign cycle this year.,5
Great content,08/01/2016,swimdude0403,Exactly the right balance of knowledge with the personal touch. I never waste my time rating anything and I LOVE this podcast,5
Always on point,08/03/2016,KatieM&$6,The news cycle makes politics unbearable but this podcast has fixed that for me. Despite only a few contributors they are diverse which makes the show much more interesting. There are seasoned and newer political journalists and as a team they are as educational as they are entertaining. I look forward to it and listen as soon as I get a show (the extras are always welcome).,5
A weekly must-listen,08/03/2016,Millennial4NPR,This podcasts makes politics fun and entertaining for the busy and easily bored (i.e. Millennials)! The hosts each bring different perspectives and commentary. I especially appreciate their dedication producing daily episodes during the RNC and DNC!,5
Excellent in depth analysis,08/04/2016,Opussama,The superb journalists make this show! I truly appreciate the experience and insight each member brings to discussions and analysis. I'm always super excited when a new episode comes out.,4
My favorite politics podcast!,08/04/2016,Oochikee,"I love, love, love this podcast. Look forward to it every week. The coverage is thorough, thoughtful, and fair. The diversity of reporters adds depth to the content. Keep up the good work!",5
Best politics podcast,08/04/2016,patohco,"What I want is critical, analytic, impartial commentary on the latest in politics. I get this and more with this podcast. The hosts make this show feel extremely welcoming and offer varying opinions that give great insight. Give it a shot.",5
My favorite part of the week,08/04/2016,tallone07,"Insightful, intelligent and entertaining. Everything you want in a politics podcast.",5
Great group dynamic,08/04/2016,jdblake,I was sad to see Ken Rudin leave the podcast but this recent crew that has been covering the 2016 Presidential Elections has been spectacular. NPR Politics is now my favorite political podcast and I just can't get enough.,5
Millennial tendencies,08/05/2016,980 fools,"Most of the panel seems inexperienced, overconfident and not very insightful; why should listeners be interested in their personal reactions to the news?",1
Fantastic,08/05/2016,Kiddeadpool,"This podcast has been a great breathe of air. Always look forward to the next podcast as well as leading me to pay more attention to politics, local and national.",5
Great weekly summary of the election,08/05/2016,Pch-16,Insightful summary. Love the show.,5
Great way to catch up,08/05/2016,Martha may whoviay,I don't watch the news shows and don't even get to listen to news radio much. This is a great condensed conversation around ongoing politics. You get a little background on the current headlines and it helps me track the storyline.,4
Politics coverage & singing!,08/05/2016,Matt&me,Please keep singing! Your coverage is great - really makes me think about politics more & I like the different takes from each person - but the singing....the singing just makes my day....,5
Fun and informative,08/05/2016,Nurselauramartin,Love the podcast! I really enjoy all the point of views and how well everyone interacts. I always get a laugh and learn something new!,5
Good!,08/05/2016,Laurasophia77,Informative and interesting.,5
They are the best!,08/05/2016,luccasthomazzi,The NPR Politics podcast is incredible good. They made my love politics even more!,5
Trash,08/05/2016,Jayfiddy,The partisanship of this podcast has become awful. It's a shame our tax dollars pay for this.,1
Great Show,08/05/2016,Delsay,Good coverage and helps to break things down in a digestible manner.,5
OUTSTANDING!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!,07/28/2016,nodiunx,"It's a rarity these days to find a means by which to stay politically informed and enjoy it at the same time. If you like politics and want to keep up to date on the political happenings, give this podcast a go.",5
"Informative, yet fun",07/28/2016,Fantastic fanatic true,Sam Sanders and the crew do a great job presenting the political news without stressing the listener out with the heaviness of politics.,5
Look forward to every week!,07/28/2016,Aaaaangelaq,"Great show. They're articulate, funny, easy to understand - listening to the podcast makes me wish I was friends with the whole group of them.",5
Why,07/28/2016,Randysf1971,Why do they have political correspondents who act like that hate their jobs covering politics?,1
False equivalency,07/28/2016,Jeepers67,Dunno. These folks came off as underwhelming and smug. So bizarre how they are acting like Trump isn't a white supremacist or at best unleashing the full violent rhetoric and tendencies of such.,2
Please ditch Sam,07/29/2016,cheers_ton,"The rest are basically fine, but listening to Sam Sanders gush makes for unlistenable audio. The guy sounds like an exhausting, precious teen on his first college interview. Worse yet, he makes a point of interrupting and talking over the other hosts at every opportunity.",1
Verbal Diarrhea,07/29/2016,kwm8271,"The content is generally pretty good, but the delivery by the hosts needs serious attention. In particular, Sam Sanders and his disturbing case of verbal diarrhea that seemingly forces him to relentlessly talk over and interrupt his fellow hosts has finally led me to the conclusion that this is one podcast that I ""can let go"".",1
Awesome Podcast,07/29/2016,Dave1223370,I've been wanting to find info on political news that's unbiased and found it here. Glad they cover the current issues and inform you on things that the average person may not know,5
Look forward to this every week!,07/29/2016,raydrift,I can't live without this podcast!,5
Outstanding coverage,07/29/2016,Ksfejf,Just listened to the conclusion of the two conventions and I have to say each morning I looked forward to the recap from the day before. I didn't even bother following coverage during the day because I knew this podcast would wrap up all the highlights. Very informative and I love the chemistry between all the hosts. Fun to listen to.,5
Lame,07/29/2016,Boskydell,"Not very smart, not thoughtful, not even mature analysis. Makes me cringe now.",1
Favorite for Political Coverage,07/29/2016,lorr116,Not boring. Love listening. Love everything & everyone on podcast. Does the best job out there of unbiased reporting.,5
Simply the best!!!,07/29/2016,menharar,"I have yet to miss an episode. Best coverage and commentary on US politics, period. Lighthearted, informative, and intelligent.",5
Nothing more than a liberal talk show,07/30/2016,Liberalnewssucks,Not a single conservative on their panel.,1
Best podcast for politics,07/30/2016,Irish Spud,"This is the best politics podcast out there, they cover news, it's like talking shop with your buddies on the Hill over beers after a long week. It's a DC politics Junkie slice of heaven. Jump into it and go see their rare live shows. They bring a good amount of diversity to the podcast with younger and older reporters to give you views from different angles and the non bias NPR quality we all enjoy",5
I look forward to Thursdays,07/30/2016,Loren07,"Thanks NPR politics team for informative and enjoyable updates. More Ron Elving, please.",5
Annoying,07/30/2016,KarSwiss,I find the constant advertisements by Sam sanders attached to the five-minute hourly news podcast to be really annoying. The same message over and over and over again that we contributors are paying for him to fly all over the country to go to conventions and chat with people. And the podcast itself lack substance. There are many competing political commentary products --this one ranks at the bottom.,1
"Fun, Informative, Conversational",07/31/2016,Koala khan,"Perfect to listen to in the car! Particularly the quick takes, I have a short commute and the 10-15 minute run time is perfect for that. I wish they had one more older, more experienced journalist to cycle in their panel. I still thoroughly enjoy it, Bravo!",5
Disappointing,07/31/2016,Qdharma,"I am infatuated with this election so I am listening to a dozen or so podcasts devoted to the race. I am surprised at how weak this NPR offering is. The guests do provide some respectable content, but overall this is surface level talk that lacks depth.",1
Hey Y'all,07/31/2016,Eas111,Best politics podcast out there. Very informative without being too dry. LOVE Sam Sanders,5
Excellent politics news roundup,07/23/2016,Joe V Wan,"Great podcast. I've been listening to the podcast since it started but leaving my first review. NPR listeners usually slant liberal but this podcast seems pretty down the middle. It's reporting and some analysis but not too much commentary/opinion. By the time it comes out I usually have read/heard most stuff already (it's news, not really deep dives) but always has some good banter/analysis etc.",5
Liberal jibberish,07/23/2016,Kilauea,"They portray as neutral reporting, but is still left wing biased. Not surprising as the source is NPR.",1
The best political podcast,07/24/2016,Catrayn7,"Clear, concise, entertaining, insightful. Thank you Ron (have missed you!), Sam, Asma, Domenico, Sarah, Susan... I am a fan!",5
Fine I guess,07/25/2016,coolfungreatgood,"If all you want is headlines without any flavor, this is a fine political podcast. It‚Äôs usually a little dated (which is to be expected for podcasts). The commentators seem to have very little grasp on pop culture, so their attempts at connecting politics to it are very cringeworthy. Also, one time the ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Let it Go‚Äù was ‚ÄúGuys, isn‚Äôt it great we‚Äôre not Brazil?!‚Äù which is the whitest tagline I‚Äôve heard in a bit.",2
LOVE!!,07/25/2016,Alygus04,"I have always been the person who didn't care and didn't know about politics. I am now 24 and given this is an election year I figured I should try to get more educated. This podcast alone has given me so much valuable, down to earth information and inspired me to be so much more interested in our political system. Thank you to the whole cast! I love this podcast!",5
Not very up-to-date,07/26/2016,mcfrank1,The adverts for this show said it would be updated every morning; but here we are at the end of the first day of the democratic convention and it hasn't been updated in 72 hours. Might as well just watch the news to keep current.,1
Great!,07/26/2016,NewCook5000,I look forward to hearing the sailors recaps of the conventions.,5
A great review of election politics,07/26/2016,Dankfoot,Do you want to catch up on all the crazy twists and turns of the 2016 election? This is the podcast for you. It's a great round table discussion from voices new and veteran. I'm particular fond of Sam Sander's moderation and humor.,5
typical left leaning,07/26/2016,pperk97,left slanted show that could be better..,2
Not Great,07/26/2016,JDavy,"Mildly entertaining at times, but overall not great. Definitely not objective, plenty of ""we don't take sides here, but (takes strong liberal position)."" Not really informative, just kinda chit chat.",2
Best politics podcast out there,07/26/2016,Paul and Rebecca in NC,My wife and I are members of different political parties and we look forward to this podcast every week. All the contributors (Sam and Asma are our favorites) provide thoughtful analysis and much needed humor in a crazy election year. Thanks and keep it coming you guys!,5
funny and insightful,07/26/2016,de_bonair,I love that the hosts genuinely sound like they are having a great time doing their jobs. They don't ever talk down to their listeners and rightly bring pop culture into the mix.,5
Very disappointing reboot,07/26/2016,ListenerNYC,"I loved the old version, which offered real insight and knowledge. You learned something when you listened. It's clear with this new version that NPR is trying to appeal to a younger crowd but it just feels amateurish. It may be nice listening to a new generation's take on politics (I'm a millennial btw) but only if they still have a good grasp on the subject, including history. The host mentioned he's covering his first conventions. Great, but why is he hosting the podcast?",1
Great podcast,07/27/2016,Gg281,I love Sam!,5
0ishee,07/27/2016,0ishee,"I like how this is informal, because that prevents this from becoming a run-of-the-mill segment from any other news agency.",5
Informative and now daily,07/27/2016,sasha888,Great insight. Calling out the dog whistles and not letting anything slip by. These guys are legit,5
Just the amount I want,07/27/2016,woodris,I want to stay on topic of politics at this time of the election process but I can't stand sitting through hours of coverage to get a smidgen of info. NPR Politics coverage give me exactly what I need and in the right amount of time I can afford to listen.,5
So good,07/27/2016,SueD12345,So so good.,5
Second most favorite - next to FiveThirtyEight,07/27/2016,junlei li,"I find this podcast interesting - but not as level headed as FiveThirtyEight. Tends to sensationalize - trying to create ""excitement"" of a ""close race"", and dive into ""controversy"", the way evening news tend to do. Good for ratings, bad for news. But, still, way better than most news coverage.",4
Lacks any educational value,07/28/2016,jbuddah,"This podcast went downhill very quickly. Starting out promising, and now it just seems to be nothing more then I get in my Facebook feed. Gone are the insightful and educational historical perspectives. What I'm left with is poorly produced conversations between people who lack diction.",1
Love this podcast,07/20/2016,Joe McDevitt,"This is probably the podcast I most look forward to each week. I work an overnight job and spend the entire shift listening to podcasts. This is a great, informative, and down to earth take on politics! Love it.",5
Fluffy,07/20/2016,Jason Cabassi,"I like this podcast best when Ron Elving is on. He's knowledgable, insightful, and witty. But almost everytime he talks, Sam Sanders or one of the other hosts interrupts with something not as interesting. I wish this podcast had less emphasis on personality and being youthful, and more on substance. I gotta say, I really miss the days of Ron Elving and Ken Rudin. I think with this latest episode I'm done with this podcast.",2
I just want facts,07/20/2016,vdiazdearce,"I tried for a while to like this show, but I just feel irritated after each episode. I don't want to constantly hear their opinions, just the news on politics.",2
I anxiously await each episode,07/20/2016,bgoleno,"I consider NPR Politics a knowledgeable, and trusted source for political news. Not only is it informative, but often entertaining as well.",5
A little soft,07/20/2016,A Conservative Democrat,So I generally like this podcast but lately it's been less hard hitting. For instance the Melania Trump speech was glossed over. I saw a more pointed interview on Fox News. The glitz and glamour was a major part of the focus which was disappointing. I'm at work all day and I look to the podcast to offer analysis not joking remarks. Come on guys do better.,4
"Lightweight, fluffy",07/20/2016,Oliver Sebastian,"Surprisingly superficial - I would expect and want more from a news organization, but the talking heads simply summarize what's obvious and add jokey asides. Shouldn't this be deeper than broadcast news? It's a podcast, and the listeners are all in - a wasted opportunity.",1
Superficiality by Millennials,07/20/2016,BuyNothing,"This is like US Magazine for political events. Nothing of substance. Talking about Melania's dress. They are careful not to offend anyone - so it's just a fluffy cookie. These folks are obviously smart and informed, why is it trying to reach a similar demographic by putting out such dumbed down content?",1
Very disappointed,07/20/2016,Kcbernst,"All hell is breaking loose at GOP convention. Trump surrogate says Hillary Clinton should be executed, Ben Carson says she is in league with the devil, Christie prosecutes her while crowd shouts ""Lock her up."" NPR likens ""Lock her up,"" to ""Drill, baby, drill."" Guess you are bending over backwards to be ""objective."" I can't listen anymore to cutesy comments and false equivalence. So disappointed even with Ron Elving who usually adds some seriousness, perspective and maturity. I'm done.",2
RNC coverage,07/20/2016,simon124,"Vapid and boring, NPR can do better than this.",1
Cringeworthy attempt at relevance,07/21/2016,Unica Sola,"There's barely any meaningful discussion--let alone insight--in this show. It consists almost entirely of lame, belabored pop-cultural references (a couple of the journalists seem like they'd rather work for People magazine than NPR). It is neither entertaining nor edifying. Please get rid of the amateurs and replace them with real professionals (like Ron Elving).",2
Style over substance,07/21/2016,runningdogyankee,Listening to the NPR Political Team's coverage of the Republican Convention has been a disappointment. The format is clearly pitched toward a reality show mindset where Melania Trump's choice of dress ranks higher than the merits of the GOP platform. Let's have less discussion about the tittle-tattle and more about the policies (or lack thereof) of the candidate and speakers. I think the listeners can handle it.,2
My Favorite Podcast,07/21/2016,bethdu22,"Really - I love this podcast! I am so confused by all of the negativity in some of these reviews, but maybe that's because I am young. This podcast has really helped me in navigating this confusing election cycle. Maybe it's not the most technically based podcast, but it gives me the information that I need while also being entertaining. Also - Sam Sanders I love you!",5
Unprofessional and amateurish,07/21/2016,Cooling1978,"I expect more from an NPR podcast. This group comes off like a group of interns who don't understand the gravity of what they're discussing. During their discussion of the first night of the RNC, they made light of the plagiarism that occurred and sang the theme song to ""Charles in Charge."" Unprofessional. Unsubscribed.",2
Listening to Politics Again!,07/21/2016,svenlore,"I used to listen to several podcasts about politics but got sick of the angry rhetoric from one side or another. The NPR political correspondents are like a breath of fresh air this political season. They are all upbeat and speak with intelligence and grace. Love the ""can't let it go"" segments. Keep up the great work during the Conventions and beyond!!",5
Lame,07/21/2016,ClickySlippers,"I downloaded this podcast to hear NPR's political analysis of the ongoing Republican convention but, instead,I heard snarky, sophomoric banter, by what sounded like only moderately informed college kids. I'll be looking for another news source.",1
Awesome podcast!,07/21/2016,Juju9691,Love this podcast! Helps me stay on track with the news and is also entertaining!,5
Informative And Fun!,07/22/2016,debkrose,This is quickly becoming my favorite political podcast. The mix of hosts/commentators is spot on and they all seem to really enjoy what their talking about--and not afraid to have a little fun with it. I always learn a lot.,5
Love it!,07/22/2016,RST19,Great relatively unbiased reporting and commentary. They go above and beyond to have a quick turn around after recent events in order to keep you up to date. Very fun and informative. Way better than watching the news!,5
Excellent and informative,07/22/2016,Booklady219,"Great podcast! I look forward to hearing the insights of these reporters with each new episode.
It's a good mix of insight and humor.",5
Love this,07/22/2016,givingjane,Love this podcast. Great crew with great rapport. Also love the quick release of a new episode whenever something big goes down (as opposed to having to wait until the next scheduled episode).,5
A good recap of political news,07/14/2016,Lauren from LA,"The unique voices and informal chatty style are refreshing. I get a good recap of what is going on ‚Äî more of a recap than a deep dive. I appreciate that there are younger and diverse voices in the mix ‚Äî makes it more accessible and brings up some good perspectives. I so look forward to this every week, and it has become my go-to to get breaking news recaps as well.",5
Probably my fave show now,07/14/2016,Erock music,"Love everyone on this show so much. Super informative, with an inside baseball take, without getting too wonky. The theme song makes me miss Ken and Ron together, but the mixing up of different groups makes for some great gabbing.",5
A lot of fun to listen to,07/15/2016,kathy_gh,Love this podcast. More entertaining than tv.,5
Regular listener,07/15/2016,Ktsd72806,Great show.,5

Making Thursday's The Best,07/17/2016,Meliboo!!,"I love this podcast so much, my roommate and I have made a ritual of listening to it on our porch at breakfast and it's just so fantastic. I love the emery and insight of the hosts, who mesh so well with each other! A truly fantastic podcast on the politics of today. I tell all of my friends about it!",5
Intelligent conversation by informed people,07/17/2016,Extemp judge,"In an election marked by uninformed people, this podcast is a breath of fresh air. Thank you podcast crew!",5
Brainy politics nerds explain the news,07/17/2016,PattyJ,"I LOVE this podcast! Not sure what some of those 2015 reviews are talking about; seems like they're fixated on comparing it with some old podcast I've never heard of. Or maybe they don't quite trust so many women and younger journalists? NPR Politics is extremely smart, fact-filled, and also relaxed enough to be really nice to listen to. I like hearing some of the brainy nerds I know from NPR ""letting down their hair"" a little, and I really appreciate the explanations and analysis of current events. I wait eagerly and devour each new episode, especially in these insane times.",5
Friendly political banter,07/17/2016,Jeeves4864,"Just listened to my first episode and really enjoyed the team's recap of recent politics. What's amazing is that it sounds like it's a group of friends catching up on their thoughts on the week. The conversation is informal and relaxed, but also full of interesting thoughts/reflections that leave you feeling more and informed and give you something to think about. Great podcast, definintely enjoyed listening in.",5
Great!,07/17/2016,DaveTheMovie,Great podcast. Very informative.,5
Love it!,07/18/2016,New to NPR political coverage,"I love this podcast! Love the folks they have on the show and their witty banter - perfect mix of facts and humor, on both sides of the political spectrum. I feel that they equally cover both sides of the recent campaign and both candidates. I tune in every episode and never miss one! Love it! Keep it coming!",5
Non-essential,07/19/2016,Gabfest fan,You'd actually be better off with the Gabfest.,3
Look Forward to Each Episode,07/19/2016,Kommando84,"I'm a self-diagnosed NPR junkie, but NPR Politics Podcast might be my favorite show each week. I love hearing the familiar voices from the news during the normal broadcast day let their hair down and share in a more free-flowing exchange than the radio format will allow. The show's stalwarts, including Sam Sanders, Dominico Montenaro, and Tamara Keith, are often joined by other great NPR radio journalists who add a nice change to the show also. Highly recommended!",5
Kids show,07/19/2016,A Clinton Republican,"Way too informal, off the cuff banter. Cut out casual remarks, do some due diligence, and maybe PBS could have an informative show!",2
Not a fashion podcast,07/19/2016,Ssjgohan80,It sickens me how far NPR has fallen. To have three people talk about Melania's dress for several minutes and talk about her speech for 10 seconds is very disappointing.,1
Came back & still don't like it.,07/19/2016,Ehodges05,If you're looking for cynical views & micro-focused hypothetical questions of what could happen - this is your podcast.,1
Juvenile tone,07/19/2016,Miltiades490,"Sounds like teenagers talking off the top of their heads, and not very seriously at that. An embarrassment for NPR.",1
Political ear candy,07/19/2016,CFramkem,"Love the commentary and straight analysis on this show. I can get my NPR politics fix on the go, delivered to my ear holes when I want it.",5
Can't let it go,07/08/2016,Bhurd6004,"I credit this podcast for my newfound political literacy, thank you! Been listening since the beginning, trying not to think about what will happen once the election is over üò¢",5
This Podcast is My Rock,07/08/2016,Marion Anne,"I've listened to this podcast from episode one and in the beginning I loved the podcast because it was frank, honest and a pretty hilarious. ;) I felt like I was truly being educated about how elections happen in America. (This would be a good time to note that I am a 23 and this is the first presidential election I'm really paying attention to and I know only the basics of the political process). This podcast was a god send and I've listened to every episode. But this podcast has grown to mean so much more to me over the past couple of months. I feel like I can't trust many news outlets out there, but I trust this podcast and when terrible things like the recent shooting in Dallas happen I turn to the NPR Politics podcast to help me make sense of the sadness and terror I feel. Thank you guys for making this podcast and please don't go away when this election is over!!",5
Fun to listen to and informative,07/09/2016,Lesleyane,"I like the upbeat style of this podcast, but I learn something too.",5
A Must Weekly Listen For Staying In Touch Politically,07/09/2016,Feisty Puma,"Don't watch the news on TV, and unfortunately I have little time left in the day for reading newspapers and news magazines. I'm a big fan of this podcast, and I appreciate NPR for starting this show. I feel so much more informed and aware of the key newsworthy stories each week.",5
Love this podcast - fun & informative,07/09/2016,Emmmmm,"Hey y'all! (Sam Sanders shoutout) I am not a political junkie, but I enjoy hearing and reading about politics around the nation. I have been listening to this podcast for many months now, and it is one of my favorites. It is a bit more casual, with seemingly younger commentators mixed in with the older and more established NPR people, which I like. I enjoy hearing from the different commentators they have on the podcast (it's not the same mix of people each time), and I'm always interested in the topics they discuss. Especially with this being a presidential election season, I get lots of good information about what is going on. What will happen after the 2016 presidential election? Will this podcast continue? I sure hope so!",5
Best Us Politics Podcast,07/09/2016,Ahamed Milhan,My weekly fix for my US Politics. Sam sanders and his team do a great job of deconstructing different political perspectives for the layman. I also appreciate the fact that they do their best to stay unbiased and produce a concise and thorough political discussion that's enjoyable to listen to.,5
Politics without the BS!,07/09/2016,Prof Nguyen,Great way to keep up with American politics!,5
Different but good,07/11/2016,Saulick,"I listened to the old podcast and loved it. I wasn't so sure about this new one, but have really come to enjoy the interaction between the reporters and the breadth of knowledge they bring to the subject. I think it contains the spirit of the original, just with more voices. Well done!",5
newsknut,07/11/2016,NewsKnut,This is a little too hipster for me although I love NPR. I guess that's likely what NPR is trying to do with this podcast. But I'm aloyal NPR listener.,3
A goto for a weekly dose of politics,07/11/2016,PennAlum,It is fun to hear their analysis of week. I also love their frequent extra podcast for breaking events.,5

Smart,07/12/2016,Darkbroccoli,This podcast is funny and serious. It has the best mix of speakers to get different viewpoints on political topics today. Keep up the great work!,5
Good podcast but very biased.,07/13/2016,dadrizzle2,Make sure to balance this out with something from elsewhere on the political spectrum.,2
Love it!,07/13/2016,NerdofSteel,"Fantastic, concise review of the political world. They make listening to what's happening in this mess of an election season funny and enjoyable üëçüëçüçæüçæ",5
Boring and Repetitive,07/14/2016,intrepidpeanut,"When it comes to solid political journalism, it tends to be very rare. So when I discovered that NPR had created a politics podcast, I was ecstatic! After listening to this podcast for a few months, I've become absolutely disgusted by it. Every week, they manage to cover the same aspects of the presidential campaign over and over again. It's either sucking up to Hillary or talking about something crazy Trump did recently. Whenever they don't talk about the campaign, it's something that's been blowing up all over the news (Newsflash, I don't live under a rock). When I discovered this podcast, I'd hope that I would gain insightful views on important political issues and up to date coverage on all aspects of the political system; bills debated in congress, decisions in the judicial system, executive actions, etc. However, this podcast falls short of these expectations by a long shot. If you're looking for a solid and informative podcast about politics, look elsewhere. 1/10",1
Best,07/14/2016,itslizrawrr,I love this podcast,5
Love the Quick Takes,07/14/2016,starkidvizsla,Love love love this podcast. It has really helped me keep up with different sides of politics. I especially appreciate the Quick Takes that help me navigate all the articles pouring out after major events. Thank you!,5
The political discussion you wish your family could have at Thanksgiving dinner but never will.,07/14/2016,SuanoD,"Amazing podcast. Great hosts, informative and nuanced. All contributors discuss topics in a very real, human way. I never thought I would say this, but listening to (these) individuals talk about politics is a highlight of my week!",5
My favorite podcast,07/14/2016,zorch1,I check daily to see if these excellent reporters have posted another cast. I find it is neverendingly informative and even humorous. Thank you so to those who play a role in making any part of this podcast program,5
Thursday round-up is AWFUL,06/28/2016,Ysalange,Lacking in knowledge and at times seem completely out of touch with what's being talked about elsewhere. Has that impending doom/ alarmist vibe in some of the statements. Stars Wars jokes as well......it blows that public radio is wasting money on stuff like this when there is so much to be talked about by people with more knowledge.,3
Trumps my other subscriptions,06/28/2016,I<3Booze,"I have a lot of podcasts I love to listen to on my commute to and from work in the mornings, and NPR Politics has become my first choice.",5
A fresh and needed reboot of my favorite podcast,06/29/2016,Laurita B.,"I listened to the former version of this podcast and loved it. I didn't realize how much more I could love having such a diverse and amazingly talented group of younger professionals giving social, historical, and often much needed racial context to important issues related to an surrounding the politics of today. Thank you for keeping me informed.",5
üôå,06/29/2016,SaraMegan03,"Thank you, NPR, for delivering politics in such an easy to digest way. I am speaking as a person who (despite living in DC for a few years after college) never has fully gotten ""into"" politics. I care, but I don't know the ins and outs. I feel that your show explains what's happening in the world of US politics in a clear and fun way.",5
Great Show!,06/29/2016,Dr. Kfalbe,.,5
Informative and entertaining,06/30/2016,ncflah,"I love this podcast! I'm a college student who for a long time associated NPR as something my grandparents listened to but I am hooked on the informative and entertaining way politics is discussed on this podcast. It's taught me a lot about how behind the scenes features of campaign season, like super delegates and party conventions, actually work.",5
Fun take on politics,06/30/2016,OhioSoldierMom,Fun and in depth. Very informal and lighthearted except when covering the really serious stuff.,5

It's a conversation,07/01/2016,sphe96,I love listening to your conversation. This feels like friends talking about different aspects of politics. Thanks for your perspective. I can't let go.... of this podcast!,5
Great,07/02/2016,Gawetn759302,So informative,5
"Yup, this is juvenile,",07/03/2016,2-1=grate,"The NPR Politics Podcast tends to be a bit juvenile, it at times can hit some insightful points, but these usually come from the most senior member of the podcast who is unfortunately not always present. For a politics podcast that is more unbiased and more politically profound I prefer the Five Thirty Eight Politics Podcast.",2
Finding the Right Balance,07/04/2016,Nita.B.Brown,"Strength of the episodes vary but overall a great listen, mostly because of the chemistry between the hosts. And what you ""can't let go"" is a priceless piece of the winning formula to the show. Fresh take on politics mixing seasoned reporters with the new. Will continue to subscribe. Thanks!!!",4
So so,07/05/2016,Nglak,I liked it when I first listened to it. But off late it has mostly become just a reporting of facts and no analysis of the issues in detail- no expert critique.,1
Zero Objectivity,07/06/2016,Williw12120,"No objectivity, blatant bis towards whatever agenda they're pushing. Just listen to the most recent episode regarding Clinton's email scandal to see how quickly they blow over everything she did and completely downplay the investigation.",1
"The term ""cutesy poo"" comes to mind.",07/06/2016,Paul Cook_1980,"I listen to this show religiously for Ron Elving's take on the political news of the day, but the rest of the group is just too fluffy for my tastes. Treat hard news with the respect it deserves.",4
Enjoyable but slightly slanted,07/06/2016,A12213131421442,"A good overview of the week's political news. Left leaning opinions do sneak in, but both sides are covered.",5
"It all works except for the ""host""",07/06/2016,Meataball23,"I would usually never write a negative review, but since they decided to let Sam become the defacto host I find the show unlistenable. I really enjoy the coverage of the campaigns and primaries but Sam too often wants to dominate the conversation with his opinions about Beyonce or whatever other inane unfunny uninteresting thing he has on his mind.",2
"Funny, balanced, informative",07/08/2016,aviperum,"The NPR Politics Podcast features very likeable personalities, commentary and analysis of every political news event, and I feel it is very fair to listeners across the political spectrum. Highly recommended!",5

Wow!,06/23/2016,Shahs gals an,It's actually pretty good.,5
"Sharp analysis, joyful banter",06/23/2016,Yelbeok,"I've found that the information and analysis that the NPR Politics team presents is unique from what I see in other media outlets; they truly bring a fresh, deep perspective. I especially appreciate the frequent references to political history and how they relate the present, e.g. the discussions of the 1968 convention and Reagan voter bloc. Top it off with effervescent banter and you've got a great way to spend 40 minutes. Thanks for providing some journalistic excellence in a sea of ""media-crity""! :)",5

Excellent podcast,06/23/2016,HJHWH,I really look forward to each of your podcasts.,5
An Establishment Media Podcast,06/24/2016,Busy Spider,"As part of the mega-media establishment, NPR Politics Podcast gives listeners only a superficial helping of what is truly current in US politics. They do not provide deep analysis into the timing of events unfolding, nor do they correct, retract, or admit erroneous, careless reporting. Some sensationalism is predictable.",3
Part of my routine,06/24/2016,das1383,"Love these guys, and now my only somewhat political wife does too.",5
Quit reading the entry together,06/24/2016,Ya boi blue,"The podcast is informative and exactly what I need when I miss the political news for the week.
Please stop reading the intro together. It is irritating. So much so that I wrote a review as an attempt to get you guys to stop.",5
Good Source for Conventional Wisdom,06/24/2016,Altadena ca,The participants clearly enjoy each other making for easy listening. It is terribly even-handed. Ron Elving and Asma Khalid are standouts and worth the subscription.,3
You can love Ken Rudin AND still love this show!,06/24/2016,Eitan Fire,"This is an excellent podcast for anyone who wants to gain a deep understanding of politics. If you're missing Ken Rudin I suggest checking out his podcast ""Political Junkie"" which is also excellent. Hearing the journalists in this show discuss political issues is like getting to be a fly on the wall of a presidential cabinet meeting. It's always exciting to see professionals at the top of their game interacting with each other. Some of the off topic banter is a little annoying since I don't actually care who is the biggest Beyonce fan. For this reason the Can't Let it Go segment can grate on my nerves and on balance the chit chat is more alienating than endearing. On the whole, though, I can't get enough of this podcast and enthusiastically recommend it to all my friends, family members, and students.",5
"Great, especially right now",06/24/2016,MoFish1981,This crew strikes the perfect balance of serious information and levity. I learn something every time and can't wait for a new one each Thursday.,4

Love it,06/25/2016,Vvheart,I just love this show and the hosts. First on my listening list.,5
Insightful and fun,06/25/2016,btimlake,"This roundtable is informative and fun. It's not as organized as Ken Rudin's, and none here has his depth of experience in politics. But with several reporters and editors, you get a range of insight into today's politics. Also appreciate the extras -- sometimes it's hard to wait a full week for the next episode.",5
Even-handed discussion mostly outside the bubble,06/25/2016,"Really, I have no nickname","We all tend to gravitate towards opinion groups that lean our own way. This show gives equal time to all sides, and while opinions are often expressed, they tend to be based on observation rather that ideology. It is a good way to understand the many sides of the arguments in the news and is a refreshing break from the one-sided channels that take up most of the space on one side or the other.",5

"Smart, savvy, and occasionally silly ‚Äì perfect!",06/17/2016,BevodySihanaka,"Listen to ""Can't let it go"" at the end of the June 16, 2016 podcast, at the very least. It's not often that you hear a reporter cry on air, let alone be so distraught that his voice continues to shake until the end of the segment. I think this is a thoughtful, articulate, and savvy group of political reporters any day. However, Sam Sanders' remarks about the ""safe places"" that exist uniquely in marginalized communities, such as the black church, gay bars, etc., are there because normal, every day spaces are not always safe for us, were particularly perceptive and demonstrated raw and unabashed empathy that I was grateful to hear from a profession that is unbiased by nature. Even-handed, accurate, and well-researched news does not have to be devoid of the emotions one experiences when reporting on highly charged events. Considering that it was an NPR story about the Orlando shooting that finally allowed me to cry this morning, it seems appropriate that I end my day listening to one of my new favorite voices prove that he truly does see the lives on which he reports. Say it again, Sam.",5
One of my favorite weekly podcasts,06/17/2016,Chris Goddard,Always enjoy this podcast... In my to 3 never miss a week shows. The quick takes are really useful too,5
Excellent for politics newbies,06/17/2016,afox2010,I was never much interested in politics before I subscribed to this podcast. Now it is my most anticipated show! This is a great way to start getting informed. The hosts are delightful and I feel like they're my buddies. Rock on!,5

Until now, I just listened to the podcasts as a means to pass time while driving, getting information about interesting topics and just pure entertainment.

Great Discussions!,06/18/2016,Allthenicknamesaretaken1234567,"I've been listening for awhile, but this week pushed me to review. It was the first regular weekly show after the Orlando massacre, and it was their best show ever. Great reporting, great analysis, personally moving, and a light moment where Tamara Keith proves herself as the standout geek of the show.

Deeply moving,06/19/2016,Masami Kojima,"I was deeply moved by Sam Sander's comment this week about the ""safe place"" in the aftermath of Orlando and reflecting back on Charleston - why we have to talk about some groups needing a safe place in the first place.

Really love the balance,06/20/2016,Cporoski,I love this podcast. It gives a balanced run through of the national politics. I have been hating the news so much lately. This is all I am going through because it is in the middle. They don't go for clickbait or inflamatory headlines. It is just keeping me updated on the news. I also love the varied ages of the reporters.,5

Fresh and Fun,06/12/2016,maghanzoe,"I'm quite enjoying this npr podcast. It is peopled with young, fresh political journalists and the occasional old hat. The reporting and analysis are always good. I rarely learn anything new here (with the exception of the existence of Hillary-inspired wine ice cream!), but I enjoy the coffee-shop feel of the discussion, and the lively personalities of the reporters shine through in a way they just can't in NPR reporting. I especially like the responses to listener questions, often from young people like themselves.

my favorite.,06/13/2016,kimbrlymay,"this podcast is what got me off my bitter chair for this entire election and actually engaged in what's going on. I love the way they talk like normal people instead of political wonks, and even when you can catch a hint of their personal biases they still give both sides and I don't feel like I'm being talked AT. the political climate today is so horrible and unpleasant, but these guys are a breath of fresh air and make something pretty nasty pretty delightful. I get so excited when I see a new episode pop up!!! I appreciate their candor and am grateful that I can be informed without being repulsed. thanks guys.",5
Love it!,06/13/2016,Anastarzia,"I look forward to this podcast each week! I like the youthful and casual feel of the reporters, even though they a few generations younger than me. I also like the news they cover.",5
‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,06/14/2016,9th ELA,"I love the NPR politics podcast! I like the informal (but informative) way that the podcast is conducted, and the general rapport between the panelists each week. While yes NPR leans to the left, I feel like the facts and details of the matters discussed on the podcast are presented in an even and reasoned way. They have definitely made keeping up with the crazy political season much easier and entertaining too!",5
Superb analysis,06/14/2016,Shemia Fagan,"Love the whole NPR team on this podcast. Great indepth analysis of the election, with a lighthearted feel that makes me feel like I'm part of a conversation with friends. I've listened to every episode and will continue to do so.",5
My favorite podcast,06/15/2016,Jy51289,"The NPR Politics podcast is the only one I listen to religiously. As soon as a new episode goes up I want to plug in! I used to live and work in DC so I feel like I understand a lot about where they are and the specific DC-references they make. More importantly, however, I have really enjoyed their commentary on the current political atmosphere of our country. The team is very knowledgable and I have learned so much about specific processes (like a contested convention!)",5
Smart and funny,06/15/2016,Blynnray,NPR Politics really does feel like I happened on a conversation between America's top political reporters.,5
Fun and informative,06/15/2016,HMCC23,I enjoy the podcast a lot. I would love to hear more Ron Elving.,4
Chit chat about politics,06/16/2016,Bridge to nowhere II,Substance-free podcast about campaign trail factoids. Entertaining sometimes.,2
Great,06/16/2016,Rbaldwin56,Do you love politics?? Then just listen it's great.,5
Can't let this go,06/16/2016,secoles,"From the time I started listening to this podcast a few months ago it has quickly become one of my favorites. They tackle some great topics head on, and always leave me more informed than before I started each podcast. Can't let it go is always a highlight of my week. Plus I think I have developed a podcast crush on Sam Sanders.",5
Great thought-provoking conversation,06/16/2016,RachelGasparini,"Always discussing hot topics but also looking at them from unique angles. Great political coverage and candid hosts. Love the informal nature of it. Sam Sanders is especially great. He gave a really emotional yet powerful testimony about the issue of feeling unsafe on the June 16th episode. I commend him for that, made me think deeply about the crisis.",5
Cool news presentation,06/16/2016,Jamey-Jame!,"Like it it's young fresh and funny. Great content, very informing, really enjoy listening!",4
Don't Fall Into Partisanship!!,06/17/2016,Shamelessly Partisan,"While being obviously liberal, usually this podcast is pretty good about keeping it centered and respectful. This last weekly roundup (June 16th, 2016) was a concerning regression. They were completely off on saying the democrats are united by citing Obama and Hillary being on the same message with no mention of Bernie Sanders and his supporters' reluctance to come to the Hillary camp. Following that, mocking Republican rules for replacing a dropped out candidate by pointing out the amont of text on the Republican rules sheet versus that of the Democrats' was immature and out of line. Usually this podcast does a decent job of at least attempting to hide its bias, please keep it that way.",3
Good podcast,06/06/2016,Alexanderwatt,This is a good podcast.,5

Don't miss a single episode!,06/07/2016,Easengrace,"My husband and I love, love, love this podcast. We can't wait to take rides together in the car so we can get our ""fix"" of Sam, Asma, Ron, Mara, Tamra, Domineco, and all the others. We then bring our kids into a hearty discussion. It's awesome! Thanks guys!",5
"Biased, unfortunately.",06/07/2016,StandAloneDieAlone,"Great Podcast if you're for one specific candidate. They don't seem to care to point out any of the major questions concerning our democratic process. They act like some are crazy for questioning what is happening, it appears they are happy with their positions in life and would like to maintain the status quo. Extremely disappointed. They're smart people that have become part of a problematic machinery and perhaps are too close to even see it.",1
Latest episode..,06/07/2016,Kriinuhhh,Hated it. Not informative. Quite bias.,1

Yay Po Junkies,06/08/2016,Binksy_Boo,"Love the new, young team on NPR's Political podcast! I thought it would be hard to replace the original political junkies, but this team has their own fresh twist and great vibe with each other. Love the ""Can't let it go"" at the end...love the wry humor. And Ron makes appearances now and then, the ""journalist emeritus."" I queue this one up along with my round-up favorites: Slate Gabfest, Diane Rehm, KCRW Left, Right and Center, Face the Nation.",5

"Used to be great, but the bias is painful.",06/08/2016,Brent Eysler,"I've learned quite a lot from this podcast, but the further we've gotten into this election cycle the more obvious the reporters bias is becoming,it's became painful to listen to and this is coming from a very liberal democrat. I've been trying but finally decided to unsubscribe from This podcast as it keeps getting worse. I'll stick with left right and center or political junkie, thank you very much.",1
"Good when it's ""available""",06/09/2016,P_Steezy,"I enjoy listening to this podcast, but the last 3 out of 4 episodes have been ""unavailable"" from the server. That's in addition to about 3 or 4 previous episodes, since the start of this podcast, that I have NEVER heard.",3
The best,06/10/2016,Deepsheeee,"I wish they recorded every day. Im addicted. Its fun, informative, in-depth, civilized analysis. Just cant get any better. Just cant let it go :-p. If you listen to podcast you get the pun, but I am still really lame for making it.",5
Always insightful,06/10/2016,Rutherford Beehave,"This podcast has really grown on me, though I do worry about the possible bias of the hosts at time. But it's very good commentary on the election.",5
Both serious and funny,06/10/2016,DrewISTANBUL,"It takes a little bit to get used to, but the banter of the panel is always funny. These reporters are out in the field covering candidates and talk to everyday people too. They study and report, but it's a freewheeling talk between colleagues, which we can listen into, write to with questions and comments. It's a great addition to my podcast list.",5
Love it!!,06/10/2016,Mcgull,"Great music, great commentaries, very informative and funny! This is all you need to stay updated. Thank you NPR Politics!",5

The quality of the podcast is excellent (as are more NPR podcasts). The commentators are eductated on the topics, open-minded, provide valuable insight and do not appear to be as rude, condesending and negative as other political podcast.

Informative & Entertaining,06/03/2016,OCYAKKER,"I wasn't sure I was going to like the format for this program because I like the traditional programs from NPR (been an NPR listener since the 80s). NPR Politics has found a way to bridge the gap between the younger and more experienced listener. The combination of statistical data and informed reporting including veteran newscasters is enlightening. I find myself looking forward to each new podcast. Great job, NPR Politics.",5
hey kidz! it's a political yak show,06/03/2016,chicken star soldier,"good lord, I am a longstanding NPR listener, but this podcast is painful to listen to. Listening to John Tesh interview a cardboard box is more insightful than this political podcast.",2

I really want to like this podcast,06/05/2016,badams2000,"I have grown progressively more frustrated with this podcast after having started out liking it. I have to echo other reviewers that this seems geared toward a younger and inexperienced audience. It's almost like an effort to teach politics 101 by some smart millennials. There's just no meat to this thing. Sam Sanders bizarrely adopts this affectation of not knowing anything about anything in the service of impartiality. This forces the remedial 6th grade feel of the podcast and by explaining topics like whitewater that are nonsense in the current context, they end up lending credence to things that aren't equivalents. Very frustrating. It's a tangible relief when an older correspondent is there to add some substance and context and not just engage in bland chatter.",2
Well done,05/28/2016,Kim Brand/3D Parts Indy,Listen all the time.,5
Perfect 2016 podcast,05/29/2016,Lorimae1176,This podcast has really helped me stay on top of a very complicated and ugly election season,5
Great details on Presdiential Campaign,05/29/2016,ryannordyke,"I don't have time to keep up with the presidential race, so I listen to this podcast while I work. It's informal and informative, but great updates from the campaign over the course of the past week, whereas most online or printed articles focus heavily in on one story. The journalists are professional and amiable. Great podcast. Highly recommend it.",5
Vapid beltway conventional wisdom.,05/29/2016,RiiMz,"I wanted to love this show. But it is boring and shallow. The hosts are unable to distinguish between meaningful events and the typical beltway storylines. The approach is too casual, too vapid. The result is that you can spend 45 minutes listening and learn nothing. I suggest NPR cancel this podcast and start over. #BringBackKenRudin",1
Love it!,05/29/2016,E schu,"Love this group. Give us more Ron Elving and Nina Totenberg when you can. Also, quit apologizing for length or fear of doing too much. We are here to listen.",4
Political Nerds and Junkies Rejoice!,05/30/2016,Drbjr90,The ESPN talk radio of politics! Jump on it! Also...I hope they start doing more episodes about politics abroad once the election's over. Help us build the global community of the politically obsessed!,5
Only one good thing,05/30/2016,librarianscott,Mara is wonderful and should have her own show. The other commentators don't listen to each other and say lots of inane comments.,2

SMKM21,05/31/2016,SMKM21,"I'd be listening to this even if Donald Trump wasn't running in this crazy election. This is a really fun and engaging way to stay informed--plus ""what we can't let go"" almost always cracks me up",5

Great podcast!,06/01/2016,Maddy3140,"I've been listening to this podcast for about a year now, and before I elaborate I should say that I'm a high schooler living in the Bay Area. I liked the casual, more conversational tone of the podcast since it has helped me (as a newcomer into the politics scene) understand the basic nuances of both the republican and democratic primary processes. But, after listening to you guys for about a year now, I have a question that I hope that you guys can help me answer. I am the daughter of a successful engineer/businessman here in the Bay Area, and I have learned recently that my family's income technically qualifies us to be the 1% that Bernie is fighting against. But, my family has donated to Bernie‚Äôs campaign since the beginning. So, as a part of the 1%, can I still be a Bernie supporter? Thanks. :)",4

Not as bad as it originally was,05/27/2016,Mr. Stasia,"I had to really stick with this one. Initially, the snot-nosed kids on the show kind of put me off but the occassional appearance of a veteran reporter helped even things out.

Horse Race Reporting,05/09/2016,ckrob,"While it's easy to report on who's ahead, who's behind and guess where things are going, how about analysts of the most important issues facing the nation or state and where the candidates stand on them at this point in time. I seldom hear about things like the prospect/desirability of campaign finance reform, why TPP is either a good or a bad idea or why few US names show up in the Panama Papers. Surely reporters can distinguish actual stories from the usual detritus we read and hear daily. It is becoming more and more possible to discern what the corporate media chooses not to cover.",5

NPR the same as Fox and CNN,05/19/2016,Crowlo,"I used to listen to NPR thinking wow, this is cool and different, they are not biased like all the other radio stations and television programs out their.",1
Finally NPR has a politics podcast again,05/19/2016,Lookatthemonkeys,Finally NPR has a politics podcast again. Very funny and informative.,5
Why?,05/20/2016,MaestroJW,"Like the world needs another pro-Hillary, corporate machine news commentary. As much as I LOVE most of what NPR puts out, this podcast is a waste of my NPR sponsorship. This is no better and often worse than CNN, MSNBC, etc... In fact, Morning Joe (MSNBC corporate media) does a better job of covering the Democratic primary than the 'unbiased' NPR politics team. Listened to 6 podcasts in a month and finally decided they were commited to their bias.",1
Disappointingly biased babble,05/21/2016,ezragoldman,"Commentators are practically offensive to anyone they discuss that isn't a moderate establishment liberal. If you are and you like an echo chamber that sounds like a few college kids talking about the US election at a bar, you will love this show. If you aren't, you'll probably just get offended.",2
I never miss an episode.,04/27/2016,Whatamidoinghere???rando,"Our political system is messed up, but if I have to hear people talk about it, these are the people I‚Äôd love to listen to. Keep it up!",5
The essential political podcast in the US,04/27/2016,Dannyjump,Smart insight and warm chemistry from NPRs best reporters and editors,5
Love it but....,04/27/2016,Mcokeefe,Please... For the love of God... SLOW DOWN! Y'all talk so fast sometimes I actually think on occasion you've sped up the podcast. Slow. Down.,5
Good snapshot of the week,04/27/2016,WeatherNut04,I started listening during the presidential election which helps sum up the happenings. They bring humor and a local perspective that I find helpful and interesting,4
Informative and entertaining,04/28/2016,Loon_a_Sea,This is such an important podcast! Great to get perspective.,5
Great weekly Politics Download,04/28/2016,Blakeprime,I enjoy the podcast. Insightful. They keep it light and fun.,5
Love!,04/29/2016,00dtree,I really enjoy this podcast for it‚Äôs comprehensibility and candid-ness! As a young voter I feel that I am getting the information I need in a way that makes sense to me. Keep it up!,5
Kind of shallow and juvenile,04/30/2016,Bright green Laurie,"One of the guys seems to take pride in his knowledge and expertise but the rest of the group seems inexpert. I want intelligence and inside information - not an informal group of 20 somethings messing around, which is what it sounds like. Tried 3 or 4 episodes and must unsubscribe. That whole stupid thing about something you cant let go of this week - and it need not be politics! - makes me irritable. Not a good program though the idea is good",2
Aaron Kipp,05/01/2016,Aaron Kipp,"Great show to help break down this fun political season, I really enjoy the group of reporters on the round table. Highly recommend the show.",5
Very entertaining!,05/01/2016,mustaphamond,Always improves my morning commute.,5

Best 2016 Election Coverage,05/04/2016,maurygarcia,"The reporters of this podcast provide excellent analysis of the ongoing 2016 presidential primaries and insight towards the general election. Covering demographics, historical statistics, and current political events, the NPR Politics Podcast has become a daily ritual. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone: from the listener who is trying to learn about politics to the political junkie.",5
Great podcast,05/04/2016,BKGharlem,Love Sam and the rotating line up. Fun and incredibly informative and insightful podcast.,5
Entertaining,05/05/2016,Gmoney2748,"As careful as the hosts are to not say anything that could be called out as ""biased"", it's evident which side they are on. Also, this podcast (and the media in general) spend too much time separating ""white males"" from the rest of the country in their analyses. Despite these things irritating me at times, the podcast is enjoyable and is good at keeping me up to date on the current presidential race. I recommend it. Republican or Democrat. Just keep in mind when listening to these shows, the hosts opinions don't necessarily have to be your opinion as well.",5
Light Informal Politics Show,05/06/2016,Djihbvfrrdgji,"If you came to this show looking to listen to a few old guys direct the talk of the day, you won't find that here. Most shows are an informal discussion of the political topic of the week. A very fun show that will keep you up to date with the news.",5
Go To Politics Podcast,05/06/2016,Lmschultzy,"My favorite politics podcast. Thanks, and keep up the great work!",5
A great way to keep current with politics,05/06/2016,Vladmech,I've gotten more interested in politics over the last couple of years but there's so much to research. NPR Politics is a great way to get a snippet across the board of the week's big political happenings.,4
Awesome listen!,05/07/2016,Joseph112,I've been a listener since the very first episode and loved every second of it! I really like all of the hosts and the style of the show-- they really cater to both political insiders and your average person. Highly recommend!!,4
Great Recap program,04/17/2016,Augiesasso,It's basically what it says: the weeks politics recap. Great to way catch up with highlights of the past weeks events.,5
a little too talky?,04/17/2016,Maroongiant,I really enjoy the candor and realness of the way these commentators and journalists react to the news and question each other. I have become a regular listener. But I wish they could make the fluffy stuff a little more concise.,4
Great introduction to politics.,04/17/2016,Biscuit Sch,"I like this podcast, and listen to it regularly. However, as someone who follows politics pretty closely, there is not a lot of new info. This would be a great summary for someone less interested in politics who still wants to know what is going on. I appreciated the in-depth exploration of how the Republican convention works. The hosts seem fun.",3
Extremely Disappointed,04/18/2016,Tegren,"Due to the election season, NPR is currently getting funding from Goldman Sachs and the Koch brothers (the CATO Institute). This podcast in particular is extremely biased. I'm disgusted with it and won't be listening anymore until well after November.",1
Love it!,04/18/2016,PhillyPhriend,Every time there's a debate or campaign announcement I check obsessively for when they release the next podcast episode -- I love hearing them pick these things apart.,5
Amazing insight,04/19/2016,DrSnarky,"The recent podcast with Benjamin Ginsberg was excellent. Amazing insight into the rules that govern the Republican convention. It was the type of detailed conversation that isn't heard anywhere, even on NPR radio!",5
Keep going!,04/20/2016,jimerogers,I impatiently wait for every episode with these talented and lighthearted media professionals. I hope they continue after the election.,5

"Informative, fun and engaging",04/21/2016,dunnboy13,"During the election cycle, this podcast is definitely a must listen to stay on top of current political events. The hosts are also engaging and fun to listen to, making something I consider not that interesting to be quite interesting.",5
Get on board with the political fun train,04/21/2016,kidpanda,"I love this podcast. It's informative, fun and not full of screaming talking heads.",5

Solidly meh,04/25/2016,Palchez,"If you know nothing about politics, this will misinform you. If you know a ton about politics, it's hard to listen to, so, par for the course I suppose.",2
Listener,04/26/2016,kbike1221,"When did NPR get so biased?

I loved the idea for this podcast, and I loved it when it first started. I am also a long time NPR listener. I started to get upset at the snarky biased remarks that the pundits make. In some ways, that is what makes it great because it is how they interact off mic, but it is also a place where people go to learn.",1
Anyone disappointed is expecting a tad much,04/13/2016,doublsh0t,"I enjoy the podcast a ton, it's great for casual commentary. AND I really appreciated the focus on conventions as of late. Keep up the good work.",5
Informative and impartial podcast,04/13/2016,thatcrazygirlintheyellow,The NPR team is incredibly thoroughly and fun to listen to in this podcast. They talk about Republicans and Democrats equally and even sometimes slip in a bit about independents. I always walk away with more knowledge of America's electoral and political system. It's just a great podcast to listen to.,5
Delightful,04/13/2016,Nanio3,I love this podcast. The NPR Politics team is delightful. They are funny and informative and always keep me engaged. I look forward to the weekly roundup and am so excited when there are surprise episodes or quick takes. My go-to for election news.,5

Love It!,04/14/2016,CaliNY,"I really love this podcast. It's upbeat, provides insight from professionals on all political sides and seems to be more about informing than persuading. I definitely recommend it!",5
Excellent,04/14/2016,Asdfghgxtccg,I have been missing this for years.,5
Favorite podcast!,04/14/2016,mars535353,"This is the only podcast I will drop everything to listen to as soon as it comes out. Informative and entertaining, I look forward to every episode. Listening to NPR Politics feels like chatting about the news of the day with friends.",5
GREAT show!,04/14/2016,Jrusao,Great show with fabulous hosts!,5
Basic necessity,04/14/2016,ctrney,Tells you everything that you need to know with full super basic explanations. You only need to listen to a few minutes of this per week to be able to have a basic conversation about everything going on in the country.,5
Underwhelming and sad,04/15/2016,jcoop29443,"I could‚Äôt hold my opinion back anymore when it comes to NPR‚Äôs lackluster attempt to revamp a show that already had a winning strategy and loyal fan base. Not to single anyone out *cough Sam Sanders *cough but this show pales in comparison to its predecessor with Ron and Ken. The contributors seem relatively clueless about the campaigns they‚Äôre supposed to be covering, ‚ÄúRobby Mook, is he from Obama world? What does he do on Hillary‚Äôs campaign?‚Äù Maybe the new format is an attempt to connect better with millennials. As a millennial, I‚Äôd just like to say I preferred the veteran political reporters take on the weekly campaign news rather than an a ill prepared group of amateurs who reference Beyonce and Jay-Z more often than they offer any meaningful or substantive political commentary. Sad!",1
Good Overview with Personable Hosts,04/15/2016,ladyjannes,"I really enjoy this podcast, it's long enough to get a little in-depth, but not too long that they get into too much detail to be boring. I like all the hosts, they seem knowledgeable while still being relatable. It's a good overview of what's going in right now in politics",4
Amazing podcast,04/15/2016,Trent Dale,Excellent source of unbiased news. Great commentary and fun to listen to. It's a great way to get political news with a little spice. These guys are funny and are very down to earth. Look forward to each new episode!,5
Fun & Informative,04/15/2016,1dancer2,"I look forward to every Politics Podcast to help fill me in on the most important issues of the week, especially when I don‚Äôt have time to read about them elsewhere. It is not the most in depth political analysis, but that isn‚Äôt the point. It is lighthearted, entertaining, and very informative. I highly recommend this podcast!",5
It will be your favorite podcast,04/15/2016,JB Skillz,"My eyes light up when I see this podcast show up in my unplayed episodes list. It's not only made me politically aware, but I feel far more confident as an informed citizen. Yes, this podcast is entertaining but I also have found it to be an important podcast as well. Furthermore, this podcast is responsible for some truly thoughtful and insightful conversations between my wife and I. I hope this podcast will continue through the election and keep up abreast of actual political journalism and genuine entertainment that makes me feel smarter when the episode concludes. Plain a simple, I'm a fan. If I could, I would buy the t-shirt.",5
Who knew politics was so much fun,04/16/2016,Scott M is awesome,The fantastically interesting weekly hosts break down the weeks political highlights in a way that is both illuminating and informative. Our current primary season feels like forever. Listen here if you still want it to feel exciting. Plus I love can't let it go.,5
The perfect politics podcast,04/16/2016,-nkr,"Smart, bipartisan, funny, insightful, challenging‚Ä¶what‚Äôs not to like? If you only follow one source of political news, this should be it. Me? I follow several sources‚Ä¶but this is my favorite.",5
Political Analysis Done Right,04/16/2016,Mr. O'Hara,"Never too serious, but never too tangent(y), this podcast consistently informs and entertains and makes following politics much easier and more enjoyable.",5
This millennial loves this podcast!,04/16/2016,Tuffh2opolo,I follow a lot of podcasts and can't listen to all new episodes. But I NEVER miss NPR Politics. Whenever there's a new episode it's the first thing I listen to. Thank you for your insights and the informal chats. I always learn something new and have a chuckle.,5
Informed political discussion,04/17/2016,DMNSparky,"In this political campaign season, I hear lots of commentators and analysts delighting in the 'horse race' aspects, as though the issues meant NOTHING. NPR Politics podcast is peopled primarily by npr reporters who are serious, but aware of the absurdities inherent in campaigns. This podcast is a refreshing alternative to the partisans and the sport-spectators, without being dry as dust.",4
Well Done Analytics,04/06/2016,Bodiam C.,I listen to this podcast as soon as it comes out and then I jones until the next one is available. What great fun!,5

Perfect politics podcast.,04/06/2016,maatomic,I can't wait for new episodes! You have made this 23 y/o interested to keep up on politics.,5
Good Effort - Needs a deeper bench,04/07/2016,Terp CJ,"I really love this podcast, and look forward to the many updates. The gang is doing a good job of covering the primaries. But as other commenters have said, you need to bring back the senior guys who can add ‚Äúcolor commentary‚Äù and depth.",5
Love this podcast!,04/08/2016,DocPolitics,"I never miss an episode of this podcast! I can't imagine going through this election cycle without it. The panel is incredibly well informed and so much fun to listen to. Thank you, and never stop recording it please!",5
Favorite,04/08/2016,NJC_1979,"My favorite podcast, excited everything I see it is new",5
Breezy and fun,04/08/2016,bsfulton80,"This is a good ‚Äúchaser‚Äù after reading/watching serious political news. Captures the issues fairly, but doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. Of the nineteen podcasts I follow somewhat regularly, this is the one I have to listen to as soon as it drops! Well done!",5
Fun way to stay informed,04/08/2016,Kruby,"I really like this podcast as a way to stay up to date on the basics of the presidential race, as well as other major topics from the political news each week. The podcasters are clearly passionate about the show, and also have a really great time working together on this. My only negative comment (which lead to 4/5 stars rather than 5/5, is that at times it gets a little ‚Äújokey‚Äù and filled with pop culture slang, which I think is great for getting really young listeners interested, but takes away from the feeling of importance and seriousness that surrounds politics.",4
Love the weekly updates!,04/08/2016,annieeelizabeth,"I totally recommend this podcast, it's a great way to keep up with the campaign trail.",5
News from real people,04/08/2016,Bethikathebunny,"Whoever is on the show always seem like real people, not just news reporters. And they are always up to date on the results. I truly enjoy listening.",5
Awesome!,04/08/2016,GeorgeSamsonite,I really enjoy the information you all provided and the dynamics each of you bring. Thanks!,5
Not entirely up to NPR standards,04/08/2016,Stephen879,"I listen to the podcast every week and I generally enjoy them, but I do get the sense that everyone on the podcast is very young. Sometimes the commentary strikes me as naive and sometimes it just seems predictably Sanders-skewed because of that. That said, this is an important source for news and commentary.",3
My favorite,04/08/2016,spiceyux,"Hands down, the political commentary highlight of my week!",5
Completely enjoyable,04/09/2016,Lonecone1,This should be the only info you get on this stupid race!,5
Voice of the youngsters,04/09/2016,Jmaline,Sounds (to my early 50‚Äôs ears) like the voice of the young NPR reporting talent. The show is at its strongest when one of the more experienced folks is there providing more long-term memory and context.,3
Love this podcast,04/10/2016,RevMcR,This podcast keeps me informed about all the interesting happenings during this fascinating election season.,5
Approachable Politics,04/10/2016,OrVT,I love this podcast because it makes politics approachable and interesting. I have been stockpiling them for my marathon training runs and they make the time fly by. Keep up the good work and send me some wine ice cream!,5
Love this Podcast,04/13/2016,Scruggbo,"Amazing podcast. Insightful, funny, and amazing panel every time.",5
Valuable perspective,03/29/2016,Kkate119,"I love when other people ""do the math"" for me. Because I listen to NPR Politics, I sound much more informed than I actually am, or maybe I'm well-informed because of it. Either way, I'm a pro at political discussions.",5
This is what I'm looking for,03/29/2016,mikeguydude,"I normally don't like politics but I think it's important to know what's going on. This podcast is exactly what I wanted, quick summaries and reviews on important or significant events in politics, just enough to keep me informed.",5
Favorite Podcast,03/30/2016,Msmeraglia,Always hungry for content. Love the show!,5
Great podcast,03/31/2016,Love the ice levels!,Good info. Good round up. Appreciate the perspectives.,4
Ken and Ron,03/31/2016,Denny Catlett,"I much prefer the old podcast with , Its All Politics, it was much more informative and interesting. This seems to be nothing more than a bunch of hipsters sitting around babbling about something they know nothing about.",1
"Usually informative, but a bit too informal",03/31/2016,AngusV,"I‚Äôve listened to this podcast from the beginning, but I have to admit that I prefer its predecessor. Ken Rudin and Ron Elving had the perfect balance of intellectual heft, history and insight on the week‚Äôs political news. The current version feels a bit more like Slate‚Äôs awful Political Gabfest. Everyone is just a little too perky and the substance often takes a back seat to the personality of who ever happens to be talking. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt let it go‚Äù really should go. I really don‚Äôt need to know who likes Beyonce or who‚Äôs obsessed with what. I get it: it‚Äôs light and makes the hosts accessible, but I don‚Äôt listen to political podcasts (or NPR, for that matter) to hang out with neato kids; I listen to them to learn stuff from people who have access to information I don‚Äôt have. Maybe I‚Äôm getting too old for this show, but at a young 50, if I‚Äôm already too old for the show, maybe the show is too young for an informed audience. I haven‚Äôt given up hope yet. I‚Äôm kinda hoping the show will find a happy medium.",3
Fantastic!,04/01/2016,NaomiLurie,"Great content and reporters, easy to listen to, entertaining. Great way to stay informed on the election.",5
"Solid discussion, little spin",04/01/2016,snick22,"Probably the best politics podcast on the web. Better qualitative analysis than 538, but still includes reference to numbers and polling. The hosts do a great job giving equal weight to different positions without taking sides or pushing an agenda, which is refreshing compared to other political podcasts.",5
Fave podcast,04/02/2016,Virgambers,"I personally love the NPR Politics podcast. I never listened to the It's All Politics one, so I have nothing to compare it to, but this is enjoyable and informative. It's definitely a bit liberal leaning (as is NPR itself) but it's good for hearing generally about what's up on the campaign trail, if not super hardcore analysis.",4
Bite-Sized Politics,04/02/2016,BigWrig,"For folks who may not have the time resources to invest into tons of political talk shows and reviews, I find this podcast to be a good way to get a grasp on what's happening within the political machine in the U.S.",5
Good 2016 Background on Presidential Race,04/02/2016,AKJAZZ,Appreciate the NPR Politics podcast for the background information on the 2016 presidential race.,5
I love this podcast,04/02/2016,Former NPR Producer,I have to admit that I‚Äôm a former NPR producer/editor ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean I listen to everything my former colleagues produce. This is an exception. I look forward to every single episode. The team often makes me laugh and I walk away from every episode knowing more about what‚Äôs happening with the campaigns. These are top-notch reporters (and great people to boot) ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth every second.,5
Establishment media at its finest,04/03/2016,taylorjvalley,"Once a great podcast, now nothing different than CNN.

Incredibly biased. Used to be based on facts, now it's all spin.",1

My favorite podcast,04/03/2016,Patrick Puppet,"This is my favorite podcast, it's smart, funny and informative. I especially enjoy the Weekly Roundup. I look forward to new episodes every week, and if one hasn't appeared I'll go back and listen to past episodes. Keep it up!",5
It fun and funny to listen to!,04/03/2016,LDS Daniel,A great relaxing way to catch up with the latest in politics because they are not hardcore and they try to have fun throughout the show. It's great and I love it! Must download for a weekly roundup of American politics!,5
good overview of campaign news in a weekly format,04/04/2016,Azulet,I like the format and the hosts on this podcast. It's nice to listen to weekly highlights and skip the daily media overload.,5
It's all..right I guess,04/04/2016,kmmcdowe09,"This show suffers terribly by being a bit like It's All Politics, but not actually it. They should bring on Ken Rudin as a guest, and then never let him leave.",3
Phenomenal,04/05/2016,Komundson,They do a fantastic job. Always look forward to their new episodes.,5
Excellent podcast,04/05/2016,Gargolito,Great breakdown of our political process by a knowledgeable and very engaging team.,5
Keeps me informed and laughing,03/24/2016,SugarMagnolia11,"I love this Podcast for several reasons. First, it's an excellent summary of the week's political news. Second, it gives some behind-the-scenes stories of life on the campaign trail with the candidates. Finally, an entire episode is the length of one sink full of dirty dishes. Highly recommend.",5
One of my favorite podcasts!,03/25/2016,Emilykatenoah,"This is one if my favorite podcasts. I look forward to Friday's when the ""Weekly Roundup"" comes out. I do wish the podcast talked more about the candidate's views vs. just who is winning and what demographics they are polling highest with. But overall this is definitely a weekly favorite!",4
Amazing!,03/25/2016,AllieF123,"I'm a huge podcast listener and subscribe to a number of political podcasts. The NPR Politics Podcast is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it! Those talking deliver knowledgable and often critical reflections on American political discourse in a fun, unbiased, and smart way. It's a must!",5
Love,03/25/2016,Ado2pod,"Amazing podcast. Somehow even when the presidential race becomes intolerable, this podcast is still awesome. Sam Sanders is especially great.",5
Off the clock and shooting the breeze,03/25/2016,adfmtp,"This show is like that bonus hit of crack for the political junkie. I like the relaxed, conversational tone. They do sometimes seem to like one candidate more than others, but this show is specifically meant to be off-the-clock and not reporting, so just deal with it. Sometimes the tone has a bit of the hipster vibe, but Ron and Tamara tend to keep that in check. Speaking of Tamara, she should be on the show more because she is a great thinker and analyst, and also because I have a bit of a crush on her.",4
Fantastic,03/25/2016,Great Katr,"Love, love this podcast. I look forward to it more than any other podcast I listen to... My only wish would be that they add a little more conversation about the candidates' stances on the issues, versus just strategies to win. But overall, happy to listen. I learn a lot, and laugh along the way.",5
Politics are now a pleasure!,03/25/2016,Lynzy143,"A great listen, making politics approachable and lighthearted, while adding considered analysis.",5

Excellent,03/26/2016,Robin‚Äôs account,"Thoughtful political news and commentary, and it's fun to listen to! ""Can't let it go"" is a hoot!",5
Good stuff,03/27/2016,BlakeinDenver,"I‚Äôm a big fan! The group of regulars have a great vibe together and I like that their combination of analysis and conversation is pretty consistently lighthearted; most other news sources dip with regularity into a much more negative tone and I appreciate that the podcast stays away from that. I started listening a few months ago for their US presidential election coverage, but if I have any criticism it would be about that very election coverage. Specifically, it seems that the election is actually the only thing they‚Äôve been covering. They did break off for an episode or two to discuss the Supreme Court situation (Scalia‚Äôs death, what it means, etc) but routinely brought that back to its relation to the presidential race. That being said it‚Äôs still an excellent podcast and I do recommend it.",4
I used to respect this podcast,03/27/2016,Sc171291,But the bias has started to show. I cannot respect a news organization that appears to be fair but shows the opposite.,1
Eh...,03/27/2016,That Demmed Pimpernel,"This show is designed to reflect NPR's trend toward millenials. The complaints of bias are a overboiled, but the show reflects millenials feelings and worldview. It isn't bad, but the vast majority of the show demonstrates the reporters relative lack of experience. They are knowledgeable enough, but don't have a very comprehensive view. I am the same age as them and often seem to remember things from way farther back than them! I started listening to Ken Rudin and Ron Elving's It's All Politics and was very sad when it was canceled. Ken and Ron had a deep and intimate knowledge of politics and brought a lot of persepective and depth to the often two dimensional world of political analysis. Unfortunately when Ron makes his few appearences on the show rather than upping their game, the team tends to view him as the ""grandpa"" whose insight is outdated and irrelevent. The show tends to devolve into a coffee shop discussion with reporters who are engaged but know another beat is coming up and don't want to be too attached.",3
Hats off to a winning panel!,03/27/2016,wrortiz,"I always look forward to seeing that little red flag telling me that another NPR Politics podcast is available. The team provides smart commentary from a cultural, analytical & behind-the-scenes perspective. It's obvious that they have as much fun putting the show together as we have listening to it.",5
Good for the political season,03/28/2016,Switchfootball,"I appreciate the extra efforts they put into the special election-night episodes. They've got to be exhausted after a full day of work, but they still take time to record an extra episode at the end of the night.",4
A Fun Listen,03/28/2016,Bobalobarob,"A Fun Listen, especially during a presidential campaign.",5
can't wait for the next one,03/28/2016,corkyspetals,"I tried it once on a whim, now I look forward to each new segment. Hey guys, consider streaming 24 hours a day.",5
Absolutely great coverage. Love it.,03/28/2016,Paul 44208,Highly recommend,5
Exactly what I needed,03/18/2016,Ausannette,Love everyone on this show. I get all the information I need and it's always entertaining.,5
"Excellent, balanced, timely podcast",03/18/2016,APrasad,"Well, you have to like NPR. You won't like it if you think NPR is a left wing pinko MSM propaganda (which it is not!)
Having said that, this is an excellent twice weekly (although thay have short updates as needed in addition to their regular scheule). This is an informal discussion by NPR correspondents who discuss the topics in nore detail than possible in broadcasts.",5
Lightweight,03/18/2016,D-weeb,Unfortunately more pop than analysis. As an informal post-analysis chat this would be okay; certainly not NPR flagship material.,2
The only source I trust for political news,03/19/2016,musigal1377,"Especially in this election environment, with all the noise and tempers and sound bites, this podcast is a welcome change.
Note that I am a millennial, so this podcast really appeals to me in the way that it sounds like a group of young political reporters just discussing political news over coffee while we listen in, but I enjoy this way of consuming political media. Also they're very responsive to questions and comments, and Sam Sanders is lowkey my bestie on Twitter so.... :P",5
love it,03/19/2016,bartlettforprez,"fun, informative, and easy to listen to. I look forward to ""what I can't let go of"" all week.",4
excellent!,03/19/2016,Fancyfel,started listening due to recommendation from Pop Rocket. Guy said panelist are younger and more relatable. so true! i look forward to listening regularly to be informed. yay!,5
Love this!,03/20/2016,Reesa Z,"I've been trying to listen to the news less because there have been so many depressing stories. Along with the frustrating candidates running for president, I like listening to this podcast because it delivers the facts without needing to listen to the nonsensical rhetoric.",5
It all politics was superior,03/20/2016,JKahzaa,I'm a younger listener and only got to listen to its all politics for a short time. I wish they brought it back.,4
Good!,03/20/2016,SmartMan2000,"Good podcast! Please always start with Sam saying ""hey y'all""",5
Great Show!,03/20/2016,NPR Lover not a H8r,I never thought I would've find a replacement for Ron Elving and Ken Rudin but I have grown to love these guys! They provide an informative message through an informal delivery of very insightful information. I am really enjoying getting to know each one of their personalities!,5

High five,03/20/2016,taocub,"Look forward to this balanced, witty, intelligent discussion with every twist and turn of this election season. Way better than the sensationalized shows on both sides of the political spectrum. And, quite lighthearted... Listen.",5

Best politics podcast. Makes sense and funny.,03/24/2016,Meemsala,I love these guys. They have a great time and they have diverse backgrounds and they don't put me to sleep. The decipher politics for me in a way that nothing else ever had,5
Pathetic,03/24/2016,Aniruddh Vashisth,Really biased view. 2016 presidential race got the real bias out these guys. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to them.,1
Suggestion = release new podcast everyday!,03/15/2016,Hma612,"Truly enjoy this podcast!
Highly recommended

Instead of only once or twice a week, it will be nice to have a new podcast every day so that we all can enjoy news podcast daily!!",5
Informative and fun,03/15/2016,JD in ME,I enjoy sitting in on the enthusiastic back-and-forth among your well-informed commentators.,4
Honestly speaking,03/16/2016,law247,"Honestly speaking, I don't like politics. Or didn't, rather. I admit I started listening to this to not sound like such an idiot at work when people ask me about the election. But this has quickly become one of the podcasts I listen to religiously. It's an easy listen, straightforward, smart, the correspondents aren't pretentious and annoying, and it's actually really entertaining. Sam Sanders is my guy.",5
Politics and chatter,03/16/2016,ltj ltj,"If you like FiveThirtyEight, New Yorker politics, and slate's politics gabfest, you'll like this. Informative, chatty, interesting, topical, timely talk from immersed expert reporters. What's not to like?",5
Love it!,03/16/2016,fleetwoodkyle,These guys are great. It's always a comfortable atmosphere and they sound like they're just hanging out on some couches in the basement. I appreciate the balance of humor and knowledge of people and the process.,5
Great Nerd speak,03/16/2016,Fonteszdr,great information and hilarious perspective from the educated and bewildered,5
Wonderful!!,03/16/2016,`music‚ô•,What a great way to be up on all things politics while also being entertained!!,5
Decent,03/17/2016,Sean Sharp,Sam Sanders almost ruins this podcast and has no business discussing politics. Fortunately the rest of the crew (including former host Ron Elving) are awesome and make up for Sanders's incompetence. I wouldn't mind a reboot of It's All Politics.,3
Great podcast but let's talk about the music,03/17/2016,cbaker23,"Guys, I love the podcast. For a normal election the intro music would work. BUT for This election, the happy go lucky, old timey theme music sounds totally out of place when followed by a discussion of racism and violence on the campaign trail.",5
Socially and culturally engaging,03/17/2016,L.o9,This is one of the most socially and culturally enhancing podcast. You feel like you're part of a robust and fun conversation about politics and the journalists on this podcast are so engaging on social media. One of my favorite things to listen to in recent memory.,5
Awesome!,03/17/2016,Fiebr√∫,Upbeat and very informative.,5
Interesting behind the scenes feel,03/18/2016,Mje9,"I like the behind the scenes feel of this podcast. If you are looking for heavy deep discussion this isn't for you. I personally listen to this when walking the dog before bed. It gets me caught up on what happened overnight ( I work nights) but doesn't get me so angry I can't sleep. I do wish that it would be a little less ""jokey"" at times, but this is probably for 20 somethings, not us old folks.",4
Great show but old school stance would be nice,03/18/2016,Urban_Monk,"I like this podcast and the crew. Def has that 'millennial' focus which can sometimes be too much, however it does keep it fun and light hearted and not dry. Makes politics more appealing. However after reading ppls reviews I do feel some more of the old school input, someone OG, would be a nice balance point in this mix. Like a wise Splinter or Yoda of the game for some extra gravitas. It feels tilted to ppls in their 20's-mid 30's... Regardless, I like what y'all are doing, word.",4
Biased,03/18/2016,DisgruntledVet19D,Hardcore democratic bias in here. I just want objective political commentary. No need to pick sides.,1
Mixed bag,03/18/2016,Horrid Golem,"Some excellent commentary unfortunately ruined by Sam Sanders. He seems like a nice enough guy, but his shocking lack of knowledge and incessant pop culture references routinely grind otherwise engaging discussions to a halt. Domenico or Ron will say something intelligent, followed by Sam's Beyonc√© or Taylor Swift comparison, followed by awkward silence and the other guests silently wonder how Sam Sanders got this job.",3
Great Podcast,03/18/2016,(Nicknames are Hard),"Can't stand Sam Sanders or his biased coverage, cringe inducing lines or his self promoting agenda. 5 stars without him and for everyone else.",4
Not sure about this,03/18/2016,Lucydiamondb,"I wonder about the responsibility of a light, jokey podcast like this in such a virulent, ugly election year. I was excited, for example, when I saw there was a special episode recorded about the violence at Trump rallies, then, when I listened to it, I was surprised how far from the tough heart of the racism and threat of violence‚Äîracial, class, and, yes, political!‚Äîthe episode stayed. I wish this podcast had the courage, or expansive, sane, relevant definition of politics that so many other NPR commentators seem to. We need that.",3
Excellent Podcast (AND Politics!),03/18/2016,Hberberet,"This is an excellent podcast. Produced to the high technical standards we expect from NPR, the NPR Politics crew brings a matching level of expertise and thoughtfulness as they deconstruct (to the extant one can) American Politics. Especially during this presidential election year, this podcast has become my ""go to"" source for talking heads. Highly recommended.",5
Great podcast,03/18/2016,Mvb113,This podcast is top notch! It's full of great information on both party primaries and their candidates. If you're looking to keep up with the election and hear good insights in an entertaining fashion this is your podcast!,5
Signal to Noise Ratio,03/18/2016,Ryan Q,the NPR Politics podcast is a great way to ingest the election without having to watch and read everything under the sun. It‚Äôs a snippet of moments in time and even fun to go back and listen to past episodes to see how crazy the entire scene has gotten.,5
"Informative, non-biased, easy listening.",03/12/2016,birdie1696,"I absolutely adore NPR's podcasts, and this one is no different. Their coverage of the presidential election is detailed, interesting, and non-biased. Can't wait to keep listening through the election cycle and beyond.",5

Speaker of my house,03/13/2016,Clarkjj7,"Love this podcast, listen to every episode. Can't get enough!",5
Really Engaging,03/13/2016,G-Radio,"This podcast has been helping me to prcess this especially nutty election. Tamara, Sam, Ron and the team are funny, whip-smart, autherntic and welcoming. They've really nailed it.",5
Something's better than nothing,03/13/2016,Susie Green,"This newest iteration of the NPR Politics podcast pales in comparison to the good old days when Ken Rudin and Ron Elving, who both actually know something about politics, could play off of each other and offer useful analysis. While Ron makes an appearance here, he is often mostly used to correct or inform the painfully obvious lack of political historical knowledge that the younger, hipper, and much less insightful hosts display much too often. To have to ask Ron what year Goldwater was on the ballot is embarrassing for everyone involved, especially coming from NPR. Listen to Ken Rudin's Political Junkie first, then listen to his ten minute conversations on Minnesota Public Radio, and then, if you still have time, listen to this.",3
Best of NPR,03/13/2016,jeddmax,"This podcast is all the quality, intelligence and honesty that we are used to experiencing with NPR- plus the opinions and perspective of the reporters. I always like to see more opinion than reporting in a podcast- news is news but the perspective on the news is no more intelligible than from the people who live it every day. Well done NPR. Entertaining, relaxed and so so smart.",5
Funny and Informative,03/13/2016,Rafi Bomb!,Great podcast to know whats going on in a fun environment.,5
An unintentionally hilarious podcast,03/13/2016,Melodious Memories,"When the ""grown ups"" are on, there is political analysis and useful information. Most of the time listening to this podcast is like overhearing the children at the kids' table on Thanksgiving talk politics. I know when the relatively novice ""regulars"" look back on this later in their careers they will cringe with some embarrassment. The level of naivety of the young correspondents is often breathtaking, especially the ""host"" Sam. One can only hope he is deliberately playing the ""village idiot"" to illuminate the issue(s) for what apparently are the most uninformed among us. Listen for the laughs and the gaffs, if for nothing else.",3
Informative and entertaining,03/14/2016,T1964T,"The hosts do a great job of taking the week‚Äôs political news and making it entertaining, informative and even funny.",5
Awesome!!,03/14/2016,UKfanUSA,NPR politics team does a great job covering the election. Definitely worth subscribing to!,5
Love it,03/14/2016,Tofutulip,I really appreciate the low key slang that gets tossed around this podcast.. Props to Sam especially for having a strong bi-partisan clown game.,5
Great political discussion,03/14/2016,UMichRCS,I love hearing from NPR's political team and getting the updates on the campaigns. Thanks for the great coverage!,5
Accessible,03/14/2016,Karne Asasa,"I love how accessible this podcast is. They don't take themselves too seriously like other podcasts often do, and it's like talking about these things with my friends and never presented in a way that makes me feel like I don't get it. Huge fan here.",5
"Ron Elving, Trump Apologist",03/14/2016,olly_x,"I've had my reservations about the informality of this forum, and how squishy analysis gets through, but when Ron Elving said that violence at Trump's rallies was not his fault, and that the populist messages of Trump and Sanders are equally to blame... Well, one more instance of NPR adopting Orwellian newspeak, to what end, I can't fathom.",1
Can't live without it,03/14/2016,Swinglary,I listen and I feel like I'm with friends catching up about work over drinks. Only their work happens to be following the most fascinating train wreck of an election season I've ever experienced. I crave their insights as well as their exaspirations.

Informal/Informational Political Talk for the Political Junkie,03/14/2016,81MeMo,"I <3 this podcast, I'm a political junkie so I knew I would like it, but it's amazing. One, it's fun to get to know the NPR personalities, it's more relaxed than radio so it has a lighter banter. Two it feels like you are behind the scenes, you get a real sense of the press conferences, debates etc. And finally, they tell you what you need to know-predictions, what if scenarios, what to look forward to. It's the best and I <3 Sam Sanders.",5
Great Poscast,03/15/2016,Iugurtha,"Fun, informal coverage and analysis about American, and sometimes international, politics.",5
It's ok...,03/15/2016,Fudfkhfh,This particular podcast does not come off as unbiased as all of npr's other segments. It consistently feels slightly unbalanced.,2
Love it,03/07/2016,Faibellig,One of my favorite podcasts right now,5
Loving this!,03/07/2016,Oldgraymidge,I started listening to this podcast in order to be informed about this year's election. What I didn't expect was to laugh. These guys present the political news of the week with such mirth and pithy insight while appearing to enjoy each other's company and humor. I find myself wishing each week that the show would not end.,5
So glad it is back,03/07/2016,ChicagoHayes8,When NPR politics ended after the last presidential election my tears of sorrow can only be compared to my tears of joy when I saw it coming back this past year. Thank you for the amazing analysis and playful style,5
Love hearing such smart & funny analysis,03/07/2016,ElleryPrescott,"This is one of my favorite politics podcasts. The analysis is always smart, funny, and interesting. These folks really know their stuff and are fun to listen to. I'm a big fan!",5
Great show,03/08/2016,A 30 year old Chicagoan,"I've really enjoyed this podcast since I subscribed a couple months ago. They cover the big topics and do a nice job of explaining things like caucuses and super delegates, but also touch on the silly aspects of the campaign like Marco Rubio's footwear and the trending topic of Ted Cruz as the zodiac killer. I enjoy the balance and I learn something new each episode. If you listen to tons of politics podcasts, perhaps you won't find anything new here aside from a more relaxed style. I basically listen to this and whatever coverage NPR plays while I'm in the car, and that's plenty of election coverage for me. Thank you NPR politics podcast for helping me feel informed and for bringing some lightness and humor to a pretty crazy election year.",5
A fun and informative show.,03/08/2016,Meepstark,"I'm really enjoying this show's coverage of the presidential campaign - it's like listening in on a fun dinner party full of political correspondents. I especially love ""Can't Let it Go,"" at the end of each episode. Great job!",5
Bad and should feel bad.,03/08/2016,themostbrian,A vile swarm of anecdotal hot takes. Stick with 538 and The Weeds.,1

More Ron Elving & Domenico Montanaro. Less Sam Sanders.,03/09/2016,NPR MA,"Sam Sanders needs to learn to stop interrupting his fellow reporters, especially when he has just asked them a question or when they are in the middle of making an excellent point. Sometimes he seems more interested in hearing the sound of his own voice than actually making sure he has something to contribute each time he speaks.",3
Political fun.,03/09/2016,Nikatepah,"Informative, intelligent, and funny-- I would love to actually sit in on these discussions.",5
"Excellent, well balanced, and really informative",03/09/2016,TheRealJsrs701,"Given the shenanigans of this election cycle, it‚Äôs easy to lose sight of the big picture.

This is a great way to keep perspective on the 2016 election process!",5
Great informative politics podcast.,03/10/2016,Maplescone,I really enjoy this podcast especially Sam Sanders. The hosts do a great job of explaining the caucus and primaries of the States and the progress of the various candidates.

Great!! Up to date information covering all sides with a personal touch.,03/10/2016,Threelip,"Fun, up-to-date, in-the-know, this podcast team is keeping me informed and happy about it.

Fun and informative,03/12/2016,musicalguy,"I really love this podcast. It is very informative and gives a great deal of background information and insight into what is going on in the 2016 presidential race, but it is also very fun. I love the back and forth banter between the various contributors in which they seek to make sense of how unusual this election cycle is. They give equal time to both parties, and they do their best to remain unbiased. Thank you so much, NPR, for creating another wonderful podcast! Kudos to all involved.",5
YES to this podcast!,03/12/2016,Travis from the MN,"I can‚Äôt get enough of this show. The commentators are fantastically down-to-earth but bring so much knowledge and insight to the discussion. You want a funny, witty, real analysis of politics? This is the show.",5

Good stuff,03/06/2016,athoughtbytim,These reporters make politics easier to understand and really fun/interesting! While they are more relaxed than most political analysts it helps make listing to a podcast about politics less dry.,5
Even tho I'm a AK I like y'all,03/06/2016,A-deadhead,"I have incessantly listen to all politics content on NPR and I will read insatiably anything I can get.

Huge Fan,03/06/2016,tookeymonster7,"Great way to stay up to date on everything going on. I think they do a good job making it lighthearted and entertaining even with the more serious subjects. Always enjoy their ""can't let it go"" segment. Curious to see where they go after the election",5
Citizen NPR Listener,03/07/2016,STLtoBOS,I appreciate this podcast very much. They give a great review of the current political picture while giving historical perspective. I feel like I could sit in with them and join the discussion (helps that I find the early 90's cultural references very funny).,5
Interesting Insight,03/07/2016,Das731,"First, the commentators don't take themselves to seriously. However, they do give a good oversight as to what has happened in the presidential election. Also, they do answer question from listeners which is important.",5

Depends on your bias,03/07/2016,L. Rumple,"I have been a big fan of NPR for a long time. I now wonder if that is because of my personal politics. This podcast covers the candidates, but the bias of the reporters comes through. Their preference for Democrats in general (and Clinton in particular) is obvious in every episode. If you‚Äôre looking for unbiased political reporting, look elsewhere. Sadly, if you can‚Äôt find it on NPR, I don‚Äôt really know where else you should look.",2

I liked the old NPR Politics and love this one,03/04/2016,Cal bro,"I really enjoyed the original NPR Politics Podcast, and occasionally try to track down Ken Rudin to listen to his take on current events. It was a fun podcast and I enjoyed listening to it. I like this one even better, because it includes a more diverse set of perspectives from a larger collection of NPRs political reporting team. I enjoy hearing them discuss and debate an issue or event, and it's clear they love their jobs and enjoy their work. If you are a political junkie, this is a refreshing take on current events. I can't recommend it enough.",5
Perspective that makes sense,03/04/2016,fmcamyg,I never knew how much I enjoyed politics until I started listening to this crew. It's like a translation for someone who never understood the language of politics.,5

Informative and Uplifting,03/04/2016,wkirchne,"Some of my favorite light hearted commentary on what can often be a depressing topic and process, I love getting my primary updates each week in the wrap up and get a real kick out of the banter. Thanks!",5
Poor execution,03/04/2016,cmbosma,"I expect more from NPR. The hosts are clearly biased towards Hillary Clinton. What‚Äôs worse is that they do not know how to interpret polls (i.e., margin of error, sampling methods, etc‚Ä¶). Moreover, they often manipulate and misinterpret quotes by the candidates. It is also clear the hosts are not posses the adequate competence to provide comprehensive coverage to the presidential election. Frankly, I am insulted by how dumbed-down and low-brow this podcast is at times. The NPR Politics podcast is seriously doing a disservice to NPR listeners.",2
Great fun and insight into politics,03/05/2016,Sin2sea,Let's face it this election cycle is quite a farce so it's nice to hear the people who covered it and their take on it. More no hold bars than you would normally expect from NPR and I personally can't get enough of it.,5
Shallow and superfluous,03/05/2016,principessa rose,"Eager for an obvious rehash of headlines you‚Äôve seen before? You‚Äôve found your podcast. This show serves up excruciatingly conventional horse-race journalism that eschews substantive analysis of political platforms and positions in favor of a light-hearted look at who‚Äôs up and who‚Äôs down in the polls. Seriously, NPR? I thought you were better than this.",1
"Now, I understand...",03/05/2016,sophie_ge94,Great podcast. Explains the politics behind the campaigns in a easy-to-follow way.,5
"Politics heavy, intensity light",03/05/2016,Mikanel,These guys do a great job of keeping the mood light while engaging in the most important aspects of national politics.,5
Same old.,03/05/2016,Yal at,Feels like a younger regurgitation of televised news. I don't care about the so called fair and balanced I want facts and some opinions are fine.,1
Wow!,03/05/2016,proudandpriceless,A parade of excellent insights in an historic election season. Please keep going.,5
Enjoying this youthful view; and do miss Ron and Ken,02/28/2016,Beth415,"I've become a regular listener to this podcast, and appreciate the fresh perspectives of these intelligent, enthusiastic young reporters. I do miss the longer view of Ron Elving and Ken Rudin and would enjoy hearing more of them and NPR's many other seasoned reporters on this valuable podcast. That said, I don't miss an episode, especially in this fascinating, fast-moving election year.",4
Informative and Fun,02/28/2016,jjr152,I wanted to show my support for the folks at the NPR Politics Podcast by saying that this is a wonderful program and that all individuals who are interested in an informative but still easy to follow politics podcast should tune in! It stays light and is great for workouts or getting ready in the morning. Love the hosts and there is always something interesting to be said.,5
Helpful!,02/28/2016,Zannedub,"These both wonky and amusing journalists are commited to following the campaign i depth and have taught me quite a bit about what is going on. They offer the interesting perspectives of those who've been to campaign events in person, and they are willing to go into detailed background and history which is very helpful.",5
Insightful and Informative.,02/28/2016,The Ebony Avenger,"Since the death of Talk of the Nation, and Ken Rudin‚Äôs Political Junkie show was relegated to an independent podcast, I‚Äôve missed hearing Ron Elving and the other members of the NPR Political staff. Humorous, timely and very informative, this podcast is a Godsend.",5
Npr,02/28/2016,PolisGuy,Good stuff.,5
Excellent Resource,02/29/2016,Sea monster 3,"I thoroughly enjoy this podcast. It is informative, balanced and entertaining. I only wish it were broadcast more frequently!",5
Great politics podcast that addresses both sides.,02/29/2016,augustaf,I listen to this podcast as my only source of what's going on in politics. It gives not only a run down on the candidates but how our system fits into the US political scheme.,5
I miss Ken Rudin too!,02/29/2016,Jnq37,"Also not enough Ron Elving and too much Sam Sanders. He's kind of annoying. Ron and Ken were awesome and had so much knowledge. I like npr politics, but it feels more like everything else out there - just a bunch of talking heads stating their opinions - rather than an education in things that have happened over the last several decades in electoral politics, reminders of what's different and what's not, highlighting remarkable parallels to candidates past. It's All Politics was a much greater value-add in my life, but I'm giving npr politics a try, because I find Slate even more annoying.",3
Great Podcasr,02/29/2016,Jake Sneeden,"Useful, informative and balanced. Appreciate the effort and thought the contributors put into its production.",5
Informative while entertaining!,03/01/2016,Beccagev,So engaging,5
Almost on par with 538,03/01/2016,Asethier,So good! Great analysis and very fun,5
I need more!,03/01/2016,Gamesesserr,"I love NPR but I'm looking for in depth analysis with something new. I want to hear about new polls and stuff not talked about on the big news channels. That being said, they still do a pretty good job of breaking down the CNN info. 4 stars.",4
Love it!,03/01/2016,Trish Oberst,"What a great podcast! I look forward to it every week. So much intelligence, so much insight.",5
NPR Politics: The Millennial Edition,03/01/2016,MG2151,"Not bad content, but the millennial-style presentation is truly insufferable for anyone older than 20-something.",1
Informative and Entertaining,03/01/2016,TheRealestKrul,"I always love hearing this podcast. It provides brief, informal, detailed, up-to-date news in a compelling way. It's become a necessary part of my week to keep up with the goings-on around the nation.",5
Great way to pass the time while driving,03/02/2016,PSUPete,Spend a lot of time on the road for work. Listen while driving. Just started listening prior to Super Tuesday. Was very interesting to go back and listen to all the previous episodes after the fact. Keep up the good work.,5
Love That NPR,03/02/2016,Lord Snerts,"Nice lighthearted political commentary from your favorite NPR correspondents.

I appreciate the quick turnaround after major events to keep me up to date on the latest political occurrences. That said, it could use more cow bell.",5
Bernie haterz,03/02/2016,FISHBOHLE,"This podcast is unabashedly dismissive of Sanders. They scoff at his campaigns plans to win the nomination, and are ALREADY condemning him to the back ""berner"" role of ""dutifully seeing his campaign through"" solely as a symbolic gesture, to honor us ""poor individual donors."" Can't they provide us a more balanced and reasonable alternative to other media sources?",2
NPR Politics,03/02/2016,mpm in OH,"Like many other listeners, I miss some of the old hands and familiar voices, and am always glad when Ron and Mara make an appearance. But I'm also open to this next generation, and understand that NPR needs to appeal to a broad audience, etc etc. However, I am growing tired of Sam Sanders seeming lack of knowledge of contemporary American politics (""why don't Republican members of Congress like Ted Cruz?"") or even basic facts of our primary system (listen to his questions about the order of the primaries). If this is a posture, meant to be some kind of audience stand-in, we don't need one. And if this ""aw shucks can you explain this to me"" stance is for real, I cannot understand his high profile in this podcast or the coverage of the election. Either way, it has undermined his credibility. I just listen to NPR--I don't work there--and know a lot more than he seems to. The years I have on him can't be the only explanation.",4
Love NPR Politics,03/03/2016,Erica-ast,"I like the fresh atmosphere and lightness to the podcast. They make it easy and fun to learn about what's going on in politics. The only negative comment I could make, is that they don't update enough. üëçüèªüòä",5
OBSESSED,02/25/2016,Katie J Corwin,"I am IN LOVE with the NPR Politics Podcast!! Sam Sanders is absolutely great and I definitely have an intellectual/real crush on him. It is also informative, funny, poignant and just all around great. I look forward to it every week and love when they do the additional Quick Takes. Everyone should listen to this podcast!!",5
Strongly recommend,02/25/2016,DJBeastFromTheEast,"As a college student starting to get into politics, I was looking for a non-biased political news source. This handles it perfectly and I‚Äôve begun recommending to people",5
To the point and accessible,02/26/2016,Dragyn140,"This politics podcast manages to be accessible to people who aren't huge politics nerds, while still being insightful and informative. Highly recommended!",5
Love this podcast,02/26/2016,Colorado listener,"I love this podcast. It is balanced and done in good humor. I also like how short it often is, usually less than 20 minutes; nice and succinct.",5
Love this podcast,02/26/2016,Julie SF,"Easy to digest, unbiased and informative.",5
Timely and Awesome,02/26/2016,Satsumahayato1,Informal but always informed.,5
Hardly objective,02/26/2016,Mark Frigon,I subscribed to get hopefully a less mainstream commentary on politics. But I'd encourage any likeminded person to just listen to the episode from Feb 26th and count the number of snickers and laughs during the GOP coverage and compare that with the converge of the DEMs.,1
Nickelback?,02/27/2016,Thomas Boone,I loved this show until I found out Sam Sanders was a Nickelback fan,1
There Are Better Options Out There,02/27/2016,skihigh2002,"I‚Äôll second the other listeners who lament the loss of the late great It‚Äôs All Politics podcast. This reincarnation is, simply, a mess. The podcast bills itself as a fly-on-the-wall view of how journalists talk to one another at the bar. If this is truly the way reporters talk to one another then journalism is serious trouble. The reporters constantly talk over each other and attempt to make each other giggle with silly jokes.",2
Bring Back the smart,02/27/2016,LauraMat,A major step down from the old version of the show. Not interested in hosts who think they are funny and smart but not really. Needs to be less about them and their social media feeds and more about the events that matter. Switching to Slate Political Gabfast.,1
I am loving the NPR Politics Podcast,02/27/2016,The Kevinater,After listening to other weekly podcasts on the election and their seemingly endless revolving door of both hosts and guests I have finally discovered the NPR Politics podcast and I love it.,5

Great podcast,02/28/2016,ingeboooo,Well done. Fun to listen to.,5
"Even, Comical Coverage",02/28/2016,FoxieJD,"I downloaded the NPR Politics Podcast on a whim, and I am so glad I did. The commentators they bring in to discuss politics are so knowledgeable and don't hesitate to explain the history behind different subjects to provide context, and they manage to do it in a way that's often really funny. Sam has great comedic timing.",5
Love it!,02/28/2016,Gsfaulkn,Thoughtful and helpful in understanding the crazy American political system and the events in the news week to week.,5
Like Improv Day at 3rd Period AP English,02/28/2016,Zukalous,I love NPR reporting (I even gave you my old car to keep you on the air) but there is just something ‚Äústiff‚Äù about the way the hosts are trying to sound ‚Äúoff the cuff‚Äù with ‚Äúbehind the scenes conversations‚Äù It feels forced like they are trying to be SPONTANEOUS. I think I figured it out. They are trying to cover too much in one podcast so it has all the spontaneity of a book report. Here are some thoughts:,3
Better than the Gabfest,02/28/2016,Mike the Canadian,I really enjoy this political podcast. And it is fresher and way less whiney than the Slate Political Gagfest.,5
"Informative, timely, and fun",02/28/2016,NH not native,"Stumbled on this podcast after hearing it live on the radio. Now I'm a confirmed fan, impatiently awaiting the next episode!",5
Brilliant!,02/28/2016,DF New Canaan,"The analyses are great fun, but the ""Can't Let It Go"" segment seals the deal.",5
Keeps Me Updated,02/23/2016,Kaitlin Marie S.,Great synopsis of what's going on in politics,5
It's about time,02/23/2016,LogicisAwesome,"NPR should have put this out years ago. Great analysis, fun conversation with some of the best reporters around. If you want to stay up to date this is one of the great ones.",5
Fun and informative,02/23/2016,AMPitup!,"Love the round table style, the back and forth banter, and the representation of different backgrounds, professionally and personally, in the revolving cast of reporters.",5
Love love love,02/23/2016,Ken3jane,"I have never been into politics and have been trying to educate myself lately. Love love love weekly roundups and adore Sam Sanders and the crew. Thank you for the time and effort on your detailed reports, even during the grueling campaign season. Only complaint: Make more podcasts üòÅ",5
If you love politics you must listen to this podcast,02/23/2016,WarDog498,I am a lover of all things politics and the NPR politics podcast is one of the best out there. What's so awesome about it is that gets you quick snapshots throughout the week as well as a quick weekly review of all things politics. The contributors or top-notch journalists and give you a fair reading of what's going on in national politics today. I highly recommend you subscribing to this podcast!,5
Different but good,02/23/2016,Little Oregonian,"Not the same when they had Ken, but I like the informal format.",5

Easy digest of current campaign events,02/24/2016,Kangarooting,Fun to listen to and gives me topics/stories to look into further.,5
What a great show!,02/24/2016,Tinyfrog Tech,I am a dabbler in politics and find this show to be really fun to listen to and very casual and informative. I am a big NPR fan and this is one of the shows that I rarely miss. I read some of the reviews with fewer stars and I can‚Äôt comprehend how others would dislike it.,5
"Youthful, smart and valuable",02/24/2016,Njfoster912,"Thank you for the work putting this together, I appreciate the points of view and the time you spend going deeper into the 2015 race, the results and their reverberations.",5

A terrific podcast,02/24/2016,Moelav,"A clear, interesting and helpful update on the political headlines. An excellent alternative to the 24hr pundit cycle. I look forward to each episode and only wish there were more each week!",5
This podcast makes sense. Politics do notüòß,02/24/2016,Zamsky,I like the information that I get from crazy politics.,5
Solid unbiased reporting,02/24/2016,tsrockstroh,All the speakers do a great job of presenting the facts. It's a great way to keep up with the current political climate.,5
Great Perspective,02/25/2016,Nickkitchens,Show does a great job of digesting the flow of info and giving an unbiased opinion on events surrounding politics.,5
"Informative, quick to react",02/25/2016,WonderRenae,"This is an excellent podcast to keep up with the election news. They have a longer weekly episode, and frequent shorter episodes to react or explain a big news story. Well done!",5
Fun with the NPR gang!,02/25/2016,Flipponzel McSnazzle,This is a great podcast. I like how they can talk about positive and negative trends for both sides without seeming like they are taking sides. It's clear that they are a group of people who just really enjoys reporting on the game that is politics.,5
Fun and informative,02/25/2016,NateCampomenosi,"Political reporters that love politics will be excited and fun when discussing things with fellow wonks, and this show is like sitting in with them all getting coffee and talking shop.",5
Podcast Listener,02/25/2016,Coz-Michael,This is a smart podcast. It features hot takes from the 2016 campaign trail by reporters from different beats.,5
Wish it dug deeper...,02/21/2016,JimFishman,"I think this podcast skews a little young/hipster-ish. I am late 30s and have listened to NPR for 15+ years, so perhaps I am aging out of the demographic they‚Äôre after here. I used to listen to the previous host, Ken Rudin, on Neal Conan‚Äôs show, and I felt his trivia and humor skewed a little old for me‚Ä¶so I am just Goldilocks looking for a political podcast. I prefer the more thoughtful, in depth news analysis that Tom Ashbrook offers on On Point‚Äôs Friday ‚ÄúWeek in the News‚Äù segment, and I just found KCRW's ‚ÄúLeft, Right, and Center‚Äù thanks to another review of this show. The jokey chit chat in this pod cast and it‚Äôs brevity just leave me wanting.",3
Politics reviewed,02/21/2016,hebion,This podcast brakes down politics in the best way possible. Biased on the side of neutrality. Wonderful.,5
Great Podcast,02/21/2016,Shark in NH,"Very good summary of what is happening in politics, especially with the Pres. election this year. I like the informal, yet informative, style. Keep up the good work, NPR!",5
"An Informative, Quick, Useful Hodgepodge",02/21/2016,TObenauf,"A self-professed political junkie, I often struggle to find a podcast or outlet to be able to discuss political going-ons. This podcast is an amazing outlet for me to do that - they analyze everything of importance, but they don‚Äôt overanalyze and they don‚Äôt force viewpoints on the listeners. The entire ‚Äúcast‚Äù has a great rapport with one another and that allows for a light-hearted, but spirited debate. Keep up the good work everyone!",5
A must listen to!,02/21/2016,Djruben133323333334556556,This npr podcast is one of the best podcast out there. This is on every time I commute to work. They really put in a way that anyone can understand. Always looking forward to a new episode.,5
Helped me change...for the better,02/21/2016,Shannanig8,"I hate politics, always have. But I'm in my 40s and I'm long overdue for keeping up. This podcast has allowed me to ease into this new area of my life and I'm actually enjoying it...something I'm surprised to be able to say. It's nice to be able to engage in political conversations with friends and know what the heck I'm talking about. If I had one criticism it's in the sound mixing. Of all the podcasts to which I subscribe, this one is recorded the lowest. I have to turn up the volume so loud that when This American Life or another comes on it blasts through my speakers. Get turnt up ya'll. :D",4
Great Podcast,02/21/2016,levirogers09,I love the podcast. Keep them coming!,5
Best politics podcast,02/22/2016,GatorGirlLiz,The awesome NPR political team at their best.,5
Excellent podcast,02/22/2016,Dr Bob K,I put this one at the top of my list each week when it comes out. The commentators have lots of experience and wisdom and share their insights with humor and clarity.,5
Great show for following the elections,02/22/2016,CBB772,Indepth quality reporting and opinions on politics.,5
Weekly Roundup Episodes are Great,02/22/2016,Godamski,"The weekly roundup episodes are a fun, easy, and quick way to catch up on politics of the past week through a balanced discussion of both the GOP and Dems.",5
Has promise,02/22/2016,mhodgins,"While I do enjoy this podcast, it feels much less than it could be. Most of the hosts (particularly the main guy) seem far too inexperienced and don't offer any real insight. The seems more like a few friends having a chat rather than a serious show. I miss the old version.",3
Strongly biased,02/22/2016,Saraj97,"I used to love this podcast, particularly when Ken Rudin was still on it. I was really excited to see that it was back, but it's proving disappointing. With each passing episode, the commentators' opinions about who will win the nominations is becoming more and more obviously biased, while being posited as fact. Newsflash- there are no forgone conclusions in either race. NPR Politics apparently fancies itself a kingmaker. I've unsubscribed.",1
Love it,02/22/2016,Foakleyoaks,Really easy way to keep up with politics with my busy day and without cable. Look forward to it each week! Really informal and gives a great view to each candidate.,5
Informative and Fun to Listen To,02/22/2016,Jerome510,"I'm reluctant to add another political podcast to my list of podcasts but after hearing the NPR Politics Podcast, I knew it was worth keeping. The staff are professional, knowledgeable, and provide witty banter.",5
"Love it, but could diversify a bit",02/22/2016,Arielska,"I love this podcast - the coverage and the hosts - it's really been engaging for me to listen. That said, I wish it was more objective or that republican-leaning speakers were brought in a guest because the casual nature of the podcast does allow the positions of the reporters to seep through. Regardless it's a great podcast that I enjoy very much",5
"Informed, engaged, and entertained",02/22/2016,matt_in_enfield,"The NPR Politics Podcast is where I am informed, engaged, and entertained (yes I said entertained) about the on goings of the political system. The NPR Politics team are extremely well spoken and enjoy working together and sharing their knowledge with their listeners.",5
Something‚Äôs being wasted.,02/22/2016,Quinn Souther,"I‚Äôve been a consistent listener for a few months now, and I‚Äôve given my opinion of the podcast enough time to develop. I had high hopes for the NPR Politics Podcast, but it falls well short of the rest of NPR‚Äôs slate of radio and podcast programming, and comes out especially disappointing for its shallowness and relative surface-skimming of the topics covered.",3
Keep up the good work,02/22/2016,MandaAnne,"Love this podcast!! Wish I could have even more. I feel informed without having to consume TV and other sensationalist media news. Great combo of the silly sidelines and the meat of the issue, with a great helping of education to help us follow what the heck is going on and what it all means.",5
Fun Talk for Politics,02/23/2016,Boomer106,"Love the group and the way they can give the updates and still keep it lighthearted. ""Can't let it go"" often is hilarious hearing about some of the goofy stuff they can't let go.",5

It's better than most,02/20/2016,Allen Don,It seems like a group of self indulgent millennials have hijacked the studio AT TIMES. But an insight or two slips thru from time to time.,3
Worth Listening,02/20/2016,Buzzy001,"Time is important to me and I enjoy listening to this podcast. Continue to provide insightful updates on political issues with guest commentators. Recent episode with Nina Totenberg on the Scalia vacancy on Supreme Court was especially interesting. I look forward to the next episode. Thanks, NPR.",4

Best. Podcast. EVER!,02/20/2016,ChupiMama,"Two questions/remarks though:
1. Why does everyone at NPR mispronounce Nevada? (first A should have ‚Äúahhh‚Äù sound)
2. Why did you give Trump a pass when he called the Pope disgraceful. No one called him out for insulting the leader of the Catholic church. All conversation focused on the wall, not his being a Protestant insulting the Catholic leader. It‚Äôs odd to me.",5
Really enjoy it.,02/20/2016,Coach-Josh,Great!,5
Weekly npr panel,02/20/2016,Tida96,"En pointe, funny. Refreshing that this panel is not like those on tv where each one interrupts and tries to one-up another.",5

Favorite politico podcast,02/21/2016,Bc in va,So glad these guys get together regularly to discuss the craziness of this cycle. I hope they'll expand to state issues of note in the future - the presidential horse race is exhausting and state politics matter more.,4

LOVE IT!!!!,02/19/2016,tukoskar,"I've never learned so much about American politics as I have from this podcast.

Lacks Substantive Discussion,02/19/2016,tcsim7,One of the most profound disappointments of the 2016 election cycle is the shift from substantive reporting to political gossip. It's unfortunate that journalists spend more time talking about the gaffes and viral moments without synthesizing the stances these presidential candidates take. NPR Politics Podcast is no exception.,2
Great balance of analysis and fun,02/19/2016,CidNight,Have loved NPR politics for years. This podcast continues that tradition with a fantastic group of journalists.,5

I wish I could like this...,02/19/2016,I Miss Ron Elving,"It's a little frustrating to listen to this podcast, because everyone in it sounds about 19 years old. They clearly have some insights, and I'm enough of a junkie to listen, but when one of them actually said ""BRB"" out loud, just a few minutes before another described a child as ""adorbs"" I realized their show was geared towards dim-witted teenagers.

Great Unbiased Political News,02/18/2016,Mike Shyu,I've been very interested in this upcoming election season and this NPR political podcast very well sums up both sides of the political parties. It explains a lot of the complexities so that the common man can understand. Get educated on how our officials get elected.,5
Conversation about politics,02/18/2016,McDale,"I've listened to this podcast since the first episode.

I am not a political guru by any means. I'm 26yrs old and this is the first presidential race I have paid much attention to.

NPR podcast to compete with the Today show,02/15/2016,Bkkposter,"This reboot of the politics podcast is a poor replacement to the original one with Ken Rudin and Ron Elving. That would predecessor was sharp. The listener could tell that the presenters had a rich history of politics and spent time every week outlining and editing the material, complete with corny puns and self-effacing jokes.",1

- They don‚Äôt drag the podcast, right on topic",5
I love this. Sanders and Keith are so great,02/16/2016,kboss13,"I'm a political obsessive and this podcast is great. I love that this is a multi-cultural perspective that will dig into things like the impact of Black Lives Matter on the election and explore demographic shifts and that it has a youthful feel but adds in the fantastic Ron Elving to give the historical perspecitve. The ""can't let it go"" feature where they dig up the political story they are thinking about is great.I would listen to Sam Sanders and Tamara Keith all day- maybe they could tag team replace Diane R when she steps down? This feels like a looser Friday News Roundup.",5
Informative and Entertaining,02/16/2016,Dgurgan,Great podcast! One of my favorites and the only political podcast that I enjoy! Efficient and entertaining!,5
Fresh Take,02/16/2016,CarlitaEK,"The conversation and banter between the commentators is lively and interesting without being biased in any particular direction. Political podcasts can so easily become dull monologues on an interesting subject, and NPR Politics masterfully avoids that.",5
"This podcast, successor to the great 'It‚Äôs All Politics' has lots of potential!",02/14/2016,petersphilo,"It‚Äôs fun to listen to an NPR show/podcast from its very inception: you can really hear it getting better.
The show‚Äôs scope is sometimes too broad for the time it has (but that is also due to the unusual number of presidential candidates) and the scheduling seems like it‚Äôs experiencing some growing pains.",5
Solid podcast,02/14/2016,Ghfbfdhvdfh,I listen to a lot of NPR podcasts and this is easily one of my favorites. Helps to keep me I formed on what's happening in the presidential race quickly and easily. Everyone should listen to this.,5

Best politics show. Period.,02/14/2016,tastewithkevin,"The NPR Politics Podcast team are so dang fun to listen to. The group digests what could be really boring information, and tosses it around to each other until there's a fun game of political hot potato being played.

Sam Sanders marry me,02/13/2016,katie exploded.,"To everyone saying this is a watered-down version of a politics podcast, get over yourself. You want journalism? Yeah, maybe go somewhere else. But if you want something that will keep you entertained while keeping you informed? You're in the right place. It's enjoyable and easy to listen to, and a great place to get your political headlines for the week. They give enough detail that you can investigate on your own for nuances, but keep things simple enough that I still pay attention (and therefore learn about!) things I typically wouldn't. And Sam Sanders' adorable (if sometimes incorrect) use of millennial jargon makes my early-20-something-liberal-politics-fangirl-heart sing.",5

Beyond the Blatherdome,02/13/2016,Scruffy Rube,"At a time when every moment on the campaign is amplified and reverberates in a media echo chamber, even eager watchers of the rave may want to run and hide.",5
Best and Worst of NPR,02/13/2016,Mr. Macleay,"I both love it, and I hate it. For context, I listen to every episode, and I listen to NPR and the BBC pretty much every day. I can't help myself, I read most articles that discuss the election when I see them. There are a few of the journalists on this podcast who can't seem to stop themselves from interrupting each other, they honestly sound like the college students who always put their hands up in class and never notice they're not leaving any room for other people to talk. It's like they're always trying to beat each other to the punchline, or finish the sentence of their colleague. That, and a solid 5 to 10 percent of the podcast is dedicated to them giggling. Now, they are having a good time and I'm not trying to fault them for it, I just don't find it as charming as they seem to. Those criticisms aside, they're all very, very smart and I often find I have learned something or thought about something in a different way due to their discussion, and for all my complaining I will keep listening.",3
Great information,02/13/2016,camman113,For those who are always on the move and for have much time to look at politics but want to stay inform this would be a great podcast for you.

Thoroughly Enjoyable,02/12/2016,The_Jon_Man,"I recently began listening to podcasts, and they've become something that I've started to depend on during my long commutes to and from work. One of the podcasts I can't wait to listen to is THIS one. The NPR Politics podcast gives you the need-to-know information about the current state of the 2016 presidential election, providing details that you wouldn't discover scrolling through your usual social media news feeds. The reporters are clearly knowledgable and possess great personalities to provide different perspectives, resulting in an on-track conversation that you can relate to. They also break down aspects of politics you may not be familiar with, such as how caucuses work. I am very glad to have discovered this! I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in learning more about today's politics.",5

Quit whining and appreciate it and Ken Rudin's Political Junkie podcast. Listen to both and appreciate that you have the opportunity to enjoy both.

Thorough and entertaining,02/12/2016,Thadwill,I've enjoyed the NPR politics coverage. You get a more in depth review of the week's politics (really just primaries now). This is the audio version of Gwen Ifill's Washington Week. A good listen while relaxing in the hot tub.,5

Great for politics junkies,02/11/2016,cshearer,"This is like listening in on a discussion about the latest 2016 election events with a bunch of wonky, funny nerds who know what they are talking about because they are there in the field. Amusing and informative.",5

I like this,02/12/2016,Cary A G,"I miss Talk of the Nation political conversation, and I do like Ken Rudin's pod cast, but I must admit that I do like this a bunch. I am somewhat older than the podcasters and I like hearing what people who (I think) are in thier 20 and 30s....not that I agree with them, but I do like hearing what my daughter thinks (if she talked to me about politics).",5

Love!,02/11/2016,clydeiii,My fav politics podcast.,5
Great podcast!,02/01/2016,Csm88,"I have been listening for several weeks and I am really enjoying this podcast. I noticed some reviewers saying that it's biased, but I completely disagree. I think NPR politics is informative, fresh, and comprehensive in it's coverage of behind the scenes campaigning. Some folks seem to be grieving the loss of It's All Politics, and that's ok. But this podcast is good! Give it a chance.",5
Could be better,02/01/2016,Alex Shepherd,"I think a lot of your enjoyment will depend on which way you lean politically. As for myself, I'm 32, male, and moderate. I do find this podcast informative at times, but the humor is beyond lame. The younger contributors sound like a hipster elite and their snarky jokes just fall flat. They should stick to giving us some good, heavy political discussion. I don't care for their 'I just can't let it go' game. I don't care what YOU can't let go. I",2
Very good,02/01/2016,Andrew Klicka,Enjoying this very good podcast. I'm totally up to speed thanks to you.,5
Fun energy,02/01/2016,Raleigh27603,I appreciate the youthful energy of this podcast compared with the more traditional npr shows. It's fun yet still very informative.,5
Entertaining without substance,02/02/2016,Silirap,"I subscribed to this podcast expecting to hear new and potentially exciting ideas about what's been happening in the political world today. I was disappointed to find that, though it's fun to listen to the banter like most other podcasts I listen to, not one of these journalists speak a single interesting or new idea. In fact the whole podcast serves primarily as an incomplete spouting of news reports.",3
A bit too much...,02/04/2016,Phiji Walter,"No hate, but what's the dealio with the politician's moves ahead? What I want to know is the moment right NOW, in this moment, DURING our present time, not what's gonna happen in six months! Ok besides that",3
Clinton '16: The Podcast,02/05/2016,deantrippe,"A sincere, but poorly executed defense of Hillary Clinton's campaign mistakes, every episode. Not an enjoyable listen for this liberal listener.",2
Clinton News Network,02/05/2016,nebsregor,"Just as biased as CNN. Everyone praises Hillary nonstop and no one calls her out on her hypocrisy. She does indeed let her donors influence her decisions. Youtube ""Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton‚Äù.",2
Sophomoric,02/06/2016,Teliesen,Superficial - irritatingly devoid of insight.,2
Love this podcast,02/06/2016,bjennifer,"I love that the participants change from podcast to podcast-- they are all interesting in their own way. I also like that you get a sense of what it is like to cover politics. Loved the story about Sam Sanders ending up in Exeter, Rhode Island. I always enjoyed It's All Politics and I miss it, but I think this is great too.",5
Very entertaining and informative,02/06/2016,JuiceKovacs,"I can not express enough, the enjoyment I receive from this podcast.",5
Good at helping you navigate politics,02/06/2016,Brzezink,Good at helping listeners navigate politics. All the team is not so good at navigating from Cambridge to Manchester.,4
Fresh Take,02/07/2016,Prin1222,"I just want to say that this podcast makes listening to politics both informative but easy. For all ages, including the younger listeners like myself, are given an entertaining spin on politics and even some current events. Shout out to the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony snippet and calling your editor ""Bae."" You definitely cater to all ages l of listeners with no political bias and I always look forward to a new release. Keep up the good work, guys.",5
They‚Äôve hit their stride,02/08/2016,I'M THE ONE LISTENER,"First one or two podcasts were a little juvenile in parts, but now it‚Äôs one of my favorite podcasts. The group provides knowledgeable banter on politics, but in a relatively easy going way like you‚Äôre overhearing the conversation of reporters sharing what they‚Äôve learned with each other over lunch and speculating on what it means. I also like the ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt let it go‚Äù segment. Good stuff! Thanks!",5
Poor very poor,02/09/2016,jessestbr,Biased. Imagine listening to a group of pundits who agree on everything and have the same establishment views and opinions orjust take lidten.,1
Politics or Pop Culture Happy Hour?,02/09/2016,puckl,"In terms of the style and tone, I felt like I was listening to Pop Culture Happy Hour. Some of the discussion was interesting and the back and forth was ok, but their glib and snarky nature was somewhat off putting. There's also a bit too much solipsism for my interest. Listening to one of the commentators read his own tweets was painful.",3
Great!,02/10/2016,iluvsns,"Interesting, entertaining, and informative! 5 thumbs up from me. üòä",5
Great show!,02/10/2016,Houseofkindling,"I think this has a really nice rhythm to it. I like the energy of the hosts. That giddy exhaustion from being out there on the trail in the middle of all this. I like NPR shows where you see hosts loosen up. You see the shape of their personality and where their passion for the subject comes from. This tries to capture the boundless energy of this wild race and what it says about America now... And of course, it's just the right thing, when you wish you could escape this election, but know you can't get enough :). Keep up the good work!",5
Great Program,02/10/2016,Isaac1954,I love this podcast,5
Love it,02/10/2016,DGammons1,Informative. Fun. Etc. always look forward to the next podcast.,5
Informal podcast about politics,12/31/2015,bananagrams80,"Sure, the tone may be slightly different from NPR radio but it's just as enjoyable and informative. Each of the contributors brings something different to the table, and it's a great way to get a fresh take on the news. Sam Sanders is hilarious and obviously very smart, but always has a youthful perspective. Love hearing Domenico Montanaro's seasoned take on the news, as a reporter who knows presidential campaigns inside and out - as a fellow New Yorker, I also enjoy his thinly veiled sarcasm. Tamara Keith and Asma Khalid are also fantastic. Love the ""can't let it go"" segment that closes each episode - wish episodes could be put out daily!",5
Very enjoyable,01/02/2016,Chase McFace,A good group of people.,4
Trying too hard to prove they aren't liberals,01/05/2016,tupetewalker,"As I listen, I keep checking myself - is this NPR? Because it sounds a little too much like CNN and their overcompensating efforts to appear moderate and placate conservative listeners. ""The lady doth protest too much...""",2
Enjoy this show,01/11/2016,Fauxcheffor5,"I enjoy the entire show but I really like the ""Can't Let It Go"" segment. Look forward to it every week.",5
Enjoyable and Appealing to a Younger Audience,01/11/2016,AHFOKC,"I really enjoy these podcasts. It's nice to have a political show that isn't only for the super hard core wonks. It's funny, light-hearted, and much more accessible than so many other political podcasts out there. One of the few political podcasts that I recommend to my students.",5
They talk over each other!,01/14/2016,Zoowing,"I enjoy a lively political discussion, but these journalists interrupt one another so frequently that it's difficult to stay with the conversation. I appreciate their enthusiasm but someone has to be the grownup in the group and maintain some order.",3
"What a great, entertaining way to stay current on the election!",01/16/2016,Shopper C,"The casual, comfortable way these consummate journalists share their week's experience makes this podcast my favorite in the 20 podcasts i follow.",5
Great podcast,01/17/2016,AWESOME00200,It's a really good podcast,5
Hooked instantly,01/17/2016,Moxxxxxccccxxxh,"I love the informality, the fact that they cover left and right, the weird interesting things the headlines might have missed. All of the contributors seem to mesh well together and the show has a good structure. I've been hooked on this one since the first show.",5
A gift with perfect timing,01/17/2016,missrrg,"I'm always shamefully out-of-touch with politics. And that's even more embarrassing (and potentially hazardous) in an election year. But NPR is looking out for me: They've created a round-table podcast (in the model of my beloved Pop Culture Happy Hour!) with a rotating panel of smart, articulate people to discuss the important issues of the day in an accessible way without being too simplistic or condescending (but that still has a wicked sense of humor). I have been thoroughly enjoying this new podcast since it came out and it makes me feel at least 70% more informed. Plus they have occasional special episodes, like the one with Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, which was one of the most informative and entertaining things I heard all year. Looking forward to having this podcast on my side over the next year and beyond.",5
I miss Ron and Ken,01/18/2016,Politics Podcast Fan,"Please at least change the intro music, it primes my brain for the OG ‚ÄúIts All Politics‚Äù and I am disappointed every time.",1
Great roundup of latest headlines for the moderately liberal,01/18/2016,abramjk,"For someone who is wishing Jon Stewart and Colbert had stayed on one more year to see us through the 2016 election, these guys do a great job catching me up on the latest from the campaign trail. It leans liberal for sure, so not surprised to see poor reviews from the more conservative folks out there.",5
Unapologetically liberal,01/20/2016,The shodiance,"The conversation is simplistic and easy to fallow, but dumbed down and lacking big details. They make to attempts to mask their liberal bias, but that's not a huge issue however even moderate republicans like myself will be frustrated fairly frequently.",3
Bite-Sized Political Information,01/23/2016,AssertiveBard,The format is excellent and the dialogue compelling. Keep up the great work üëçüèº,5
Fantastic,01/24/2016,Dorordian,By far one of my favorite podcasts to listen to. The quality is great and NpR does its best to offer non-biased coverage of the political field.,5
Great information!,01/25/2016,Episource412,Easy to understand and relatively bias free,5
Casual and Educational,01/27/2016,Keith Britt,"It's really like eavesdropping on a a conversation between 3 or 4 people that are crazy smart. Hearing what people on the inside of politics actually think is illuminating and striking. I wasn't optimistic when this podcast first came out, but now it's the one I look forward to most.",5
Bring back it's all politics.,01/29/2016,NanMan11,Do it.,1
This is great!,01/29/2016,knoxmartin,I enjoy this podcast for two reasons. 1) It just gives you a quick update on what's going on within the election cycle. 2) The banter is always related and never feels forced.,5
Politics Happy Hour,01/30/2016,Patchoulidrop,"Not very balanced, but I could bear that since I'm liberal. I can't bear the "" cool kid"" feel of the episodes with the mostly younger correspondents. The episodes about polling and caucusing were informative. The snarky, knowing laughs and talking over one another is becoming too much, though. I was hoping for a little extra coverage during the elections, but I think that I CAN let this podcast go.",2
A lot of talk about Republicans,11/27/2015,Camgue,"The whole of the show is centered around the Republican Party. It seems they've already endorsed Hillary as the Democratic presidential candidate. Very little talk about Bernie Sanders and when they do it's very dismissive. None about O'Malley or his platform. So I guess if your voting in the republican primary and voting republican, or already know Clinton is you girl then this is the perfect podcast for you. However if your looking for an open perspective this isn't the podcast for you. I would suggest recasting the show with more independent hosts.",2
Missing 'It's All Politics',11/28/2015,TimyT,"Unlike NPR's equally unceremonious ouster of Bob Edwards a decade ago in a clumsy attempt to capture a younger audience for 'Morning Edition', the elimination of Ken Rudin and reduction of Ron Elving from 'Its All Politics' may succeed in alienating the installed base.",2
AMAZING!!,12/01/2015,Md0ggg,"Really really informative, keeps and captures your attention. Definitely recommend.",5
Needs some time to sort itself out,12/02/2015,Chair Pilot,In time this could be good but right now the disorganization lets bias come through and makes it hard to follow.,2
Too much talking over one another,12/02/2015,Occasional reviewwr,Just listened to the podcast on politicians‚Äô apps. I had to stop midway as I found one of the hosts interrupting / talking over the others too much. It was too distracting and took away from the topic of discussion.,3
Coffee Table Politics,12/09/2015,1996e,"I've listened to this show past the Terror Attacks episode and the podcast seems really jumbled. They all seem to want to get what they want to say in and we're hearing a recorded conversation of that. However, it doesn't seem to be fact-checked and contains no more intuition or insight than a normal news article. Example: Bernie Sanders seemed uncomfortable with foreign policy questions and they ""heard"" that the team behind Bernie Sanders was against CBS including more foreign policy questions. There were more conjectures, thoughts, a random analogy, but no source was named. For all we know, that could be a rumor. I'll have to read a news article to know, which nullifies the point of this podcast. Another example: Ted Cruz. They talked about Obama criticizing about how ""someone"" wanted to close the doors to Syrian refugees and that was disappointing after all America had done to welcome that family/person. Well, they pointed out that Obama didn't name him specifically, so how did they know it was him? Maybe they have insider info and could tell us more details, but I suppose I'll have to look up more articles to know. This podcast was created to inform on politics but it seems to be spreading rumors and not news. They've only attacked candidates, not explained what their stance on issues is. I haven't learned anything and I listened up to the Weekly Roundup of Tuesday November before I couldn't take it anymore.",2
"Shallow, lazy analysis",12/11/2015,Sahl2013,"Early on, one analyst commented that people are not afraid of socialism because when they hear ""social"" they think ""social media"". This week, someone implied older people are scared and want to ban Muslims because they're used to the enemy being in a uniform and part of a state army.",2
Love the new show,12/11/2015,Daniel Groce,Great round table discussions from varying perspectives!,5
I also miss Ken Rudin,12/12/2015,Iheartpuppies,"When I listen to a political podcast from NPR I expect it to be interesting and well informed. These people seem like amateurs or undergrad college students and not seasoned and thoughtful journalists. I always thought the critique of NPR as being overly liberal was a silly argument from the right, but this podcast provides those critics with exhibit A. I live in Brooklyn and am a liberal- if I wanted to hear discussion amongst superficially diverse but internally intellectually homogenous then I wold just go to a local coffee shop. This is beneath NPR and should be revamped.",1
Meh,12/14/2015,Spadakiss,Meh,3
Patronizing,12/18/2015,Steve Whitlock,Does not help to overcome widespread sophomoric pseudo-intellectualism in our political discourse. Feels like I'm with smart kids on caffeine prepping for their SAT in a bouncy house elated with knowing self-congratulatory chuckles and attempted irony. Feels great! Totally!,1
Great!,12/18/2015,Heartontheleft,"An entertaining sum up of the weeks news. This is not meant to be an unbiased, completely journalistic account of the news. You can get that elsewhere. This is cathartic, funny, casual, and insightful. I will continue to listen to every episode they put out!",5
YES!!! Filling the It‚Äôs All Politics void!!!,12/19/2015,Mistletoe Whistler,"I LOVE this. It‚Äôs All Politics used to be my great love and I was heart broken when it ended. So, so glad to have Ron Elving ( <3 ) back on the air! xxx",5
Not for me,12/21/2015,JoshSLC,"I love politics. I loved the old ""It's All Politics"" podcast. This current version feels an awful lot like a bland rehashing of the week's news headlines. I read the news... I certainly don't need or want to waste my time on a simple review. After three weeks, I unsubscribed.",2
Would be MUCH better if...,12/24/2015,Queen Celeste,they cut out the smug hilarity. It is UNBEARABLE and turns what could be otherwise an enjoyable podcast into a rage-generating machine. The moment they start their giggly banter I just want to rip my ears off.,3
wonderful,12/25/2015,gbaby202,"an informative, insightful, and interesting listen especially the great roundup at the end of the week. highly recommended",5
Wow,12/25/2015,Larry Flake,Wonderful listen,5
Nerdy Fan!,12/27/2015,El'sAppleAccount,This is a great news source for me. I am a lover of politics and current events. This is a great place to learn the small things I didn't know about. It also gives little pieces of interesting news as well. Thank you to the whole team!,5
Disappointed.,12/30/2015,fictionbased,"I usually listen to NPR on the way to work; however, having recently decided to give podcasts a go I was extremely bothered at how much of this podcast was just pandering to an audience that wants to hear semi-factual statements repeated in order to feel warm and fuzzy. Give me facts, not cute sound bits. Define and explain concepts, rather than gloss over them because the bar is so low. I appreciate the effort, but I will be looking elsewhere for informative discussions on politics.",2
"Welcome back, NPR Politics!",12/30/2015,JWeber121,"So happy to see this show come back. It has a different feel from It's All Politics, but I think it works better for the show. I'm glad to see that it is better the second time around.",5
If you like to listen to interruptions...,11/15/2015,ckernahan1,"I am an NPR junkie and I wanted to love this, but after listening to all the episodes so far I'm not comfortable with the way in which these folks interrupt each other constantly. It's uncomfortable. Also, from Episode 1-a philosophy professor is not a real philosopher? Huh? Maybe it's just a function of the pace but I'm not sure why you NEED that pace. It's more fun to listen to people take turns rather than tryinig to shout each other down.",3
Thanks!,11/15/2015,Nachtigr1,Informative and enjoyable. Thanks for your efforts!,5
Idiocracy,11/15/2015,Captian Mario Skywalker,"I listen to public radio with an expectation that the ideas will be a little more informed. The show on socialism was a slap in the face as a 20 year old. I know about numerous successful European WellCare states, and I'm not the only one! I don't think of social media when I think of a political system. You're conclusion lumps all young people together under an umbrella of ignorance. It feels like the same tone the mainstream media takes. Which only moves our culture closer to idiocracy and anti intellectualism.",2
Terrible fact checking,11/16/2015,spacesurfer9,They sound totally out of touch in the first episode by promising philosophy majors they'll be able to find jobs as professors or politicians or NPR radio hosts while they poo poo getting a more practical education like welding. They clearly don't understand the economy or cost of college and thus cant understand other political viewpoints. One sided political shows are boring,1
Sad start,11/16/2015,NicoPDX,"I'm a long time listener to NPR and enjoyed previous editions of this show. This version seems light on facts and heavy on cuteness. For example, how about getting some facts into the podcast such as a serious discussion that included defining democratic socialism, instead of popular theme songs from fictional TV dramas and repeating (again, and again) that Americans don't understand the term. It's no wonder we are confused with this kind of cutesy coverage.",1
Fun listen,11/16/2015,sweetnightingale88,I have enjoyed this podcast so far. Fun and informative. Glad to have another politics podcast to add to my playlist. I just wish it was longer. I feel like an hour long show would allow more discussion on topics.,5
I miss Ken Rudin,11/16/2015,The old NPR listener,"NPRs old ""it's all politics"" had something. Ken and Ron felt like two old journalists that had seen everything and could give an objective/light hearted take on the situation. This is not that. This feels like a group of moderately liberal, political enthusiasts at a coffee shop having a good time. Instead of objectivity, we can hear the bias slip through. Hilary Clinton's issues are talked about with sadness, sadness at her failure to be a better candidate. While Rubio is talked about as an idiot for claiming a philosophy degree makes less than a welder. Ron attempts to talk about it objectively but one person can only bring so much objectivity to an amateur journalist chat. Fox News assuredly started the death of true journalism, but it seems every news agency wants to make sure it's truly in the ground.",2
Another home run in NPR podcasts,11/16/2015,Greg Vince,"A year out from the '16 election, NPR politics provides some fun election discussion. I enjoy it.",5
Great listen,11/17/2015,Great listen for RG,Good for the lay person,5
Awesome,11/18/2015,no alarms,Brilliant podcast,5
Skip this podcast for now.,11/18/2015,Fan of radio lab and criminal,So far not very compelling. The commentators small talk too much as if we really care what they think as much as the subject matter. This works for celebrities. But not for relatively unknown journalists. I need some buy in first. Why should I care about their perspective? Working for npr is not compelling enough.,1
Pretty terrible,11/19/2015,houston john,"This is NPR‚Äôs B-team telling you who said what with no interesting or useful insight or commentary. You might as well just scan headlines, because there‚Äôs nothing more than that here. Really disappointing given the usual quality of NPR podcasts.",1
Great new podcast from NPR,11/19/2015,Apepper44,"This is a great new podcast from NPR. It's sort of an open discussion among NPR political reporters about what's new in the political world. It's somewhat modeled after Pop Culture Happy Hour, which is one of my favorite podcasts. So I'm subscribed and looking forward to future podcasts!",5
"Dumbed down, less informative, and less funny than It's all Politics",11/19/2015,Skylar C.,"I'm still frustrated that NPR cancelled it's all politics in favor of this type of show.

NPR seems to think that the best way to appeal to young listeners it to treat them as if they have the intelligence of a fifth grader.",2
A jumble / talking over each other,11/20/2015,judge*smails,"I've listened to two episodes, and I wasn't able to make it to the end of either of them. My main frustration was that one of the male hosts consistently interrupted comments by the other commentators. In the episode regarding the future of the Republican Party, this particular host repeatedly asked Mara Liasson for her perspective on the topic, and then interrupted and spoke over her answer. Obnoxious, and a sharp contrast with the style of ""The Week In Politics"" (All Things Considered weekly segment).",2
Biased and uneducated,11/22/2015,Glory Ape,Based on biased opinion without any regard for what is actually conducive to our nation.,1
You've GOT to be kidding me.,11/22/2015,Mendy's Banya,"If you're part of the ""blacks can't be racist"", ""I should be punished for having white skin"", & ""coddle the terrorist"" segment of society, then you'll be as happy as a liberal in an all white college talking about how they LOVE helping minorities. Garbage.üë¥üèªüëéüèø",1
drivel,11/23/2015,Dglaze99,"Wow, what a disappointment. A re-play of the week‚Äôs politically-themed stories would have been far better than this group sitting around amusing each other and making sophomoric jokes. No editing. No production. Did any thought actually go into this product?",1
Too Cutesy & Not Interesting,11/25/2015,Dennis987,"Way too much cute banter and not enough real discussion. What might make for fun conversation around the coffee maker is not worth recording and broadcasting. C'mon NPR, you can do better.",1
Good Podcast,11/27/2015,jaredlwong,"Hopefully, as the political circus winds down as we near the November, this podcast will feel less strictly liberal.",5
Are We to Be in the Forum or the Circus?,11/10/2015,Tom Thumber,"Trying to fulfill every stereotype put forward by the National Review and the W. St Journal about Public Radio, this p‚Äôcast comes with an earnest affectation of being hip and youthful while it is merely insipid and sophomoric. Has the legacy of Walter Lippmann been so eroded by time that we are only left this juvinalia of patter song political thought? Does NPR have that much contempt for the younger half of America's ability to think as this? Forgive me but isn‚Äôt it the ability of a free people to govern themselves that is supposed to be discussed‚Äîor has that been lost to laughter?",1
Tom Thumber is an idiot,11/12/2015,Vinomutt,"Zero content has been released for this podcast, except for a 3min introduction. How can anyone review anything!?! A terrible, long winded, rash, jumping the gun reactionary response. Full of big words to sound really smart and 'in the know'! Tom is probably a food critic for yelp.",5

Informal Political Talk,11/13/2015,Tejum07,I loved the informal nature of the podcast. I like the little digs and jokes made about the candidates. Not what you would hear on the radio - which makes this unique and great.,5
Welcome back NPR Politics! (v 2.0),11/13/2015,Roadwarrior3571,"Just listened to the first 30 min episode & really enjoyed the multiple topics and perspectives. Has a bit of the ""behind-the-sceens"" feel, which I like & was not just a re-hash of stuff you have already heard/read. Long-time fan of Ron Elving and Tamara Keith for their insightful reporting. Sam & Danielle are new to me but they provided valuable contributions as well. Great job, NPR!",5
Avoid if you're seeking unbiased discussion,11/13/2015,JDPerson1,"After having high hopes for this podcast, I was disappointed from the get-go to discover just how much of a liberal tilt it had. In the first five minutes alone, one of the hosts matter-of-factly claimed that Marco Rubio lied in saying welders make more than philosophers. Her evidence? Philosophy professors make more than welders according to the BLS. Ironically enough, the speaker was a philosophy major (in the wide sense of the word, a philosopher) but somehow thought only professors were philosophers. Not a single co-host pushed back on her outlandish conclusion to point out that it's a little more difficult than that to know if what Rubio said is true. The rest of the conversation was more of the same. Slate's political podcast is more neutral, so I'll be sticking to it and Ricochet.",2
Excellent podcast,11/14/2015,just-mccoy,"Although this incarnation of the podcast ""It's all politics"" is without the very knowledgeable (and funny) Ken Rudin, it shows great promise - at least based on the first episode which I listened to today. I have missed Ron Elving and Ken Rudin's signature banter, their astute analysis and almost encyclopedic knowledge of American politics, especially with such a weird presidential primary in motion.",5
Great podcast,11/14/2015,dabell,"Not fox ""news"" it's NPR, sorry it's not conservative enough for some of the review complainers! Plenty of right wing podcasts, radio and a whole channel just for that. Everyone is not a republican, or right winged!",5

"It's no ""It's All Politics""",11/14/2015,Geoff17,"It's 4 stars since it fills that void of a regular political show from NPR, but nothing can compare to IAP and I can't ignore it.",4
Self-Validation,11/14/2015,TV113,"NPR's politics podcast is really an exercise in self-validation and pales compared to KCRW's Left, Right and Center. At it's core, it is a superficially diverse, intellectually homogenous group bleating what could literally be the party line. Worse, it's a chorus rather than a solo with no one speaker particuarly standing out and rewarding the listener for his/her time.",2
Super annoying and one sided.,05/02/2019,Stockettofficial,Unfortunately NPR seems to be part of the fake news movement. I used to think they were not so one sided.,1
Politics Made Fun,05/02/2019,SmallBusinessCEO,Nationa Public Radio's team of political reporters make it fun the hear about current political events. The topics are of up-to-the-minute interest to everyone with an interest is politics.,5
Better than the news.,05/03/2019,j-arnold,"In this political environment, we need real information with thoughtful commentary. NPR is the best reliable content provider in this realm, this podcast the best manifestation!",5
Let Beyonce go!,05/03/2019,Bro1492,"I love this podcast! However, there's way too much Beyonce- especially from Ayesha Rascoe whom I adore.",4
Really?????,05/03/2019,kmtig16,"Long time listener, but just listened to the coverage of the Venezuela coup. They listed the reasons the United States is interested in the outcome without even talking about OIL. Jesus get better at international politics if you‚Äôre going to comment on it. Plus comparing Maduro to Assad is just awful.",1
