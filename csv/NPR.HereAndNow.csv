Great news daily newscast,03/26/2019,Prophittman,I listen every day. Love it that it is in podcast format.,5
So annoying,03/03/2019,Kempt,Whose idea was it to break this program up into little pieces? Why do you have to ruin something that worked just fine?,3
Baseball free agent 2/28/19,02/28/2019,Skinny Kangaroo,"This an awesome midday program you can catch on NPR. But if you miss it you can always catch up with either the first hour plus the second if you have a mind too. Iâ€™m writing about todayâ€™s program 2/28/19 first hour when it was wondered if free agent Brice Harper would get picked up, despite his huge price tag. It was suggested that maybe Philly (tongue in cheek) would make the deal. Well surprise, they did for a whopping 330 million. ðŸ¤‘",5
News and interesting science,12/13/2018,Rick in Marietta,Enjoy the news and get interesting scientific pieces thrown in from time to time.,5
Pretty good daily news summary,05/25/2018,MoVal Likes Papa John,Title says it for me,4
I canâ€™t thank you enough...,12/22/2017,Calle13calle13,I truly appreciate all the unbiased journalistic work you do every single day. I rely on NPR to get my news and other wonderful and sometimes not so pleasant stories. The tone set by two main radio hosts distinguish this podcast from at least a hundred with similar format.,5
love,12/16/2017,durnanuhr,it,5
Long time listener,10/04/2017,Quality over Quanity,Used to be a great news source! Recently has been chopped up by ADHD podcast editors into 5 min segments that donâ€™t do the old format justice.,1
two parts is fine,10/02/2017,rserl1ng,"Iâ€™m assuming post-production delays the publishing of each segment, and this way one half does not have to wait for the other half to be done in order to air. This may be less convenient with the iOS 11 update because episodes donâ€™t queue up as handily, and itâ€™s a lot harder to determine what you have or have not listened to.",5
My morning update every morning,12/17/2016,Annaly Sullivan,"I'm studying abroad In the U.K. this year and am only able to keep on top of what's happening back home by listening to this podcast every morning. Even though I was 100% pro Hillary, I appreciated the balanced viewpoints they presented leading up to the election. After I got over my shock at Trump's win, re listening to some of those episodes helped me comprehend who voted for Trump and what their reasoning was, beyond the surface level fascism/racism/sexism that I tend to associate with the man. Thank you Here and Now!",5
I used to be able to download the whole show,07/14/2013,Gruups 61,Now each hour long show is split up into six minute chunks. What the?,2
Why?,07/16/2013,PlainClaude,Why did you change the format? It was niceâ€¦now it's not.,3
Needs to Offer Full Program,07/17/2013,akampfer,"I think it's fine they offer individual stories, but for those of us doing something where playing with the iPod all the time is inconvienient, please consider offering a full podcast. Otherwise, good program.",4
Love the show and the option to skip shows,07/20/2013,Dr. Tesch,I love your show! I was very disappointed when the podcasts were delayed after the new format but now that they are back I'm happy. Given the feedback of the other listeners it might be a good idea to have an option (another parallel podcast?) to download the entire show but I like the separation by story and hope you keep it up.,5
Full show was great!,07/21/2013,Robininsm,I loved the full show. But 5 minute pieces are really annoying and inconvenient as a podcast. Please return to the full one hour episodes. I will still give my 5 stars for the old full format.,5
Neal Conan for this?,07/21/2013,bmchan,I tried but this is a simple rehash of news events without the thoughtful discussion. I have unsubscribed. Then to learn that Ken Rudin is leaving and ending his podcast? My listening habits have been decimated. When is Tom Ashbrook's last episode?,1
Love the separate story format,07/22/2013,SaintBernardus,"Hmm, don't get it. Why is everyone so down on a separate podcast for each story? I love it. You can quickly advance to the next story and delete those that don't interest you. Any decent podcast app will play them in succession if that's what you desire.",5
I really enjoy this show and am thankful for the change in format.,07/24/2013,snowmantoolboy,"I too had to stop following Talk of the Nation because of the way the sections were posted, but there may be a good middle ground. It is possible to publish a single podcast and seperate it into internal chapters. That would enable people to have one download that is easily updated and still have the ability to choose which sections you wish to listen to. You can also name and give notes for each individual section. I would love to see NPR adopt this format for all of it's podcasts.",5
Was good in old format,07/24/2013,iGreeley,I could choose stories and skip those I don't care for and keep those for a repeate listen. The big blocks kills this. Having a big block of the show makes it a morass. Time to unsubscribe and move on to another podcast.,2
Podcast Format Compromise,07/31/2013,PeterKagey,"I'm the apparently rare listener who likes the program parsed by segment. Perhaps two streams could be released, one with the whole episode and another with the program parsed up.",5
I dislike the bundling of different topics,08/10/2013,Vicsal,"Again, I'm having a very difficult time finding a podcast replacement for TOTN. I very much enjoyed the way TOTN segmented its wonderful shows. The practice worked well with its up-to-30 minutes-per-topic format. I downloaded only the topics that were of interest to me and didn't have to listen to stuff that didn't interest me.",2
Boring news mag,09/10/2013,Mattyd325,"I've tried to give it a chance when TOTN went off the air, but it is just too boring. Where are the long (30 min) discussions? Where are the interesting opinions from people across the country? This feels like All this considered and Morning Edition.",1
Anti marijuana diatribe,04/21/2014,jbeckr,They turned their podcast into a modern version of reefer madness. I did not realize that pot meant the end of civilization. Un subscribed.,2
I love this podcast!,05/15/2015,guitarmanzw,"I have been listening NPR for a while, and Here and Now is one of my favorite podcast, I heard B.B.Kingâ€™s story, I like this singer and Here and Now!",5
Improved,07/31/2015,Curtis310,Much better with the hour long format.,5
New format is disappointing,06/14/2016,ÛŒÙˆ,I love Here & Now. But recently they changed the description format and it is not user friendly. I was able to read to read a brief description of all the stories and pick my favorite but now I just don't listen. Please bring back the description and story highlights.,2
Good podcast but...,06/14/2016,anthony12275,They take long to update their content. Sometimes you will get today's news tomorrow. Horrible.,2
Keep the hour segment length.,07/04/2016,mutemike,"A big fan of the show, but recently individual stories of about 5min have been pushed out. Ugh, I don't want that in a news podcast.",3
Great,08/07/2016,RadioAddct,Interesting and well-produced stories,5
News in Detail,11/30/2016,Mission Accomplished,Nicely delivered information and never boring.,5
"Good effort, butâ€¦.",07/04/2013,jefemarks,â€¦.doesnâ€™t meet the higher standard of the just-cancelled Talk of The Nation,3
Listener,07/06/2013,NOLA RUNS,No new podcasts since 06/29. I miss Neil & TOTN,1
There & Thenâ€¦..,07/10/2013,One of the best!,"Very disappointed that one of my favorite news magazines and podcasts has been usurped by NPR, and their inane podcast format. I really wish they would abandon this notion of releasing each story as a separate podcast, and instead release the SHOW, as a whole, as a single podcast. As it is now, it's cumbersome and annoying to manage as a listener, and you don't the music, segues, and connective material that makes the show enjoyable.",1
I agree,07/11/2013,Cory707,"Love ""Here & Now"" and I'm looking forward to the addition of Jeremy Hobson.
But I agree with many of the other posts here -- I don't listen to the show over the radio but am an avid podcast subscriber. We don't want the show broken up into 5 minute pieces. Post the whole show!",3
