That‚Äôs okay, but then just call the pod something more appropriate like the npr politics podcast, left leaning edition (rolls off the tongue).

"33","BIASED BIASED BIASED!!!",2019-02-06,"Joe Sturza","This is the most biased group of ""journalists"" I have ever listened too. It is blatantly obvious that they have nothing good at all to say about President Trump and his administration. I personally am a Trump fan, but there are both things I like and don't like about him; just as there are things I like and don't like about his opposition. I am not by any means a journalist and don't get upset easily, but this is absolutely ridiculous. I subscribed to this podcast to obtain unbiased political news and updates, but all I am getting is the much UNWANTED OPINIONS of a group of salty Trump opposers. To say that Trump even hinted (in his State of the Union speech on 2/5/2019) towards having the opinion that immigration is bad for or hurting this country is such a flat out lie. These people obviously can't distinguish the difference between the terms ‚ÄúILLEGAL immigration‚Äù and ‚ÄúLEGAL immigration‚Äù. He specifically stated (not in so many words, but) that he is very supportive of LEGAL immigration, and that he is very much so (obviously) against ILLEGAL immigration. Not once did touch on his opinion towards immigration, because Trump (like the rest of us that don't have our heads up our you know whats, or like those that can actually put there salty feeling towards Trump aside [you know the sore-loser feelings because they lost the election] and recognize/do what is right for the country) can actually distinguish the difference between ILLEGAL and LEGAL immigration. That is just one example, but this group of ‚Äújournalists‚Äù is exactly what is wrong with journalism, and why Americans like myself are losing faith in journalism.",1,"Politics"
"34","It‚Äôs politics! For kids!!!",2019-02-11,"Espnfsbysdth","I really do want to like this show. I have been a listener since mid 2016, but they are doing a disservice to their listeners. There is an active refusal by the hosts to ever state a fact portraying republicans in a negative light without also saying something negative about democrats. It is the ignorance of a group of people who are clearly unaffected by politics and see it more as a hobby to be laughed about than something serious. Sometimes there truly is a right and a wrong but you won‚Äôt learn about it here.",1,"Politics"

I‚Äôve been surprised by the journalists open biases before, but this week broke my formerly positive opinion of them into pieces. When speaking about the clear Dem front runner so far, Bernie Sanders, they have literally chuckled, scoffed and belittled their way through every coverage of him. It is maddening. I‚Äôm no blind follower if Bernie, I just want to hear his views like everyone else‚Äôs. They literally asked him WHY he needs to run at all, when his policies have already made it onto the Democratic agenda. Well, why on earth shouldn‚Äôt he run, if he was so successful at getting good ideas out there? If Bernie‚Äôs an idiot, why would Warren, Harris, Booker and a plethora of other candidates adopt his views? (And where in the world is the coverage of Andrew Yang?) NPR is really showing their pro-war, pro-corporation bias here. Stop telling us who COULD or COULDN‚ÄôT win. You screwed that up last election.

"51","Personality-driven, very informal ""news-lite""",2018-12-31,"Mauimike6","This is a very informal personality-driven ""news chat"" podcast wherein four or five NPR correspondents meet several times a week to offer up their personal takes on a few high-visibility news items and political issues that dominate the current news cycle. No in-depth analyses here, just quick, off-the-cuff observations about inside-the-Beltway ""hot topics."" Although the format bears some resemblance to a formal round-robin-style discussion overseen by a moderator, the reality has more of a ""newsies gathering at the office cooler"" feel to it: lots of ""me-first"" interruptions, inside joking, and everybody talking at once. On the rare occasion when a more senior correspondent joins the group, or if that day's news cycle includes a lot of ""serious"" topics, actual in-depth analysis and serious discussion may occur. This podcast's ""unscripted content"" is not on the level of PBS's Shields and Brooks podcast. It appeals more to regular NPR listeners who enjoy hearing what their favorite correspondents are like without a script... or adult supervision.",2,"Politics"

This is important to point out for the same reason that people who look at a red map and interpret that to mean the republicans significantly outnumber democrats is wrong. Land doesn‚Äôt vote.

A rotating panel of hosts and contributors offer varying viewpoints. And each of them does their best to make sure the information being shared is accessible. Anyone who bemoans this approach as ‚Äúdumbing things down‚Äù is discounting the importance of welcoming new and young ears to the NPR listener audience. This is a smart and entertaining review of political news that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.",5,"Politics"

"317","Blather",2018-01-04,"badfaith33","I didn‚Äôt find this podcast to be very informative or enlightening. They remind me of the talking heads that can be found on any television news show. On most days, they can spent 30-45 minutes jabbering about ideas that have already been thoroughly dissected in other news sources, including NPR itself. There is also an annoying attempt to appear ‚Äúnonpartison‚Äù, without analyzing, validating or critiquing the truth claims espoused by politicians. For example, some thorough analysis of the tax overhaul and it‚Äôs growth (jobs/gdp/debt) assumptions would have been nice; or a repeated critique of the 2017 healthcare reform (that never seemed to have anything to do with healthcare reform) might have displayed some journalistic excellence; or if they‚Äôre going to treat and reread the president‚Äôs tweets as official white house communication, some validation of the truthfulness of the statements might be journalistically responsible. If I‚Äôm doubting the significance of the content of a podcast, then I suppose I should be listening to something else. They had nothing meaningful to discuss in the first week of 2018, so most of the first podcast was spent talking about the consequence of the future November election and possible legislative agendas for 2018. It was an absolute waste of 30 minutes of my life.

NPR staff is getting younger, and if NPR is to endure it must attract a younger audience, too. This crew is doing it, and they are doing a good job. The frequent appearances by more seasoned hands like Ron and Mara Liasson add enriching perspective. I'm one of the old listeners (in my sixties) and have spent my share of senior executive time in the DC mill, and still I learn every time I listen.

But that maybe because I am a hopeless news junkie and have nothing better going on in my life. So please be sure to make up your own mind about this podcast and don't pay any attention to this ""five star"" review. Ok ... here are some of my most recent thoughts about this podcast. A) Is it just me or does the stature & quality of this podcast goes way up when Ron and/or Mara are on the panel? If yes ... is adult supervision is what this podcast needs to make it a truly must listen every week? My vote is YES. B) I like Scott Detrow ... but man, he has the worst nasal tone voice I have ever heard. He should definitely go see an ENT specialist just to make sure there is no cotton ball mysteriously stuck in one or both of his nostrils. C) Tamra Keith has the potential to be awesome. What stands in the way is her ever present tendency to chuckle profusely to her own clever lines. If she can only somehow guard against that, she could shoot straight to the top and have her own podcast someday. D) Finally, having Susan Davis & Tamra Keith both on the panel at the same time is ... shall we say an exercise in redundancy! They both talk & sound the exact same! They are like the siamese twins of political commentary!! F) One last thing ... Can't let it go segment is good sometimes, but honestly most of the times it comes through as too cute by half. Do we really need this segment? I think the panel enjoys (and gets amused) by it a lot more than the listeners do. But I suppose no real harm in keeping this segment on.",5,"Politics"

It's weekly and about 45 minutes to an hour. I love it. I listen every week. When NPR's daily news update advertised THIS podcast, though, I was interested to hear a daily briefing on the RNC/DNC conventions, so I subscribed. Back in 2016, NPR was beding over backward trying to be ""young"" and ""hip"" and not use big words or talk about policy in depth. So that 20-year-olds wouldn't be bored. I guess the message (withering reviews) were received, though, and they retooled the podcast to have youthful energy but restored the intellectual heft. They just did a special on the proposed tax bill in Congress--just the policy, not the politics--and you couldn't ask for more serious analysis and understanding. As of mid-to-late 2017, the contributors are knowledgeable, experienced, and fun but informative and authoritative. And they actually have contact with heavy-hitters in D.C. on a regular basis. This is the best weekly summary of U.S. politics.",5,"Politics"

It's like they're enjoying each other's company so much that they have no tone that's related to what they're presenting. I wish they would strive to present their views in a neutral way.

"475","The best way to know your government",2017-09-17,"MattChandronait","We've largely lost ""beat"" reporters; those journalists that spend years and sometimes their whole careers living in and covering a topic. NPR is one of few resources that still values that aspect of the profession. This podcast is one degree away from hanging out inside the halls of the American Congress, White House, and the capitol in general. What's more, in a world of shouters trying to shout over other shouters, it's so refreshing to get analysis and thoughtful detail without the insults and demonization. The Left and Right in the US love to retreat to their corners and listen only to their own echo chambers, and in this sense the NPR Politics podcast is likely to make a lot of people frustrated because they're not just going to tell you what you want to hear. They have empathy for everyone across the electorate and try to cover all the communities they come across while traveling with campaigns, on Air Force one, hanging out at state fairs, or just talking in their studio in Washington DC. They rotate their cast based on who can best speak to whatever is going on in the moment so in about 30-45 minutes a week you're going to feel caught up on everything critical in the political landscape of the United States. And, even better, from journalists who will make you think about and feel the real world around you. It's impossible to overstate the importance of being knowledgeable about the folks in your government making decisions every day that can drastically affect you and everyone you know. This podcast is the very best way to get that knowledge.",5,"Politics"

The cast tries to balance breadth and depth in their show, which is likely never to be perfect. Many other people who rated this podcast lamented the lack of depth; however, I think that it would be a mistake to call this podcast dumbed down. Rather, I think the cast tries to put news into helpful context and largely succeeds in this endeavor. Could they potentially dive deeper? Sure. Could there be less banter and more sober analysis? Sure. But I think the scope of this podcast is a good one that is worthy of pursuit, and the crew does a great job.",5,"Politics"

"582","First podcast I subscribed to",2017-09-07,"adeekd","I really like this NPR politics podcast. I feel like it picks the biggest stories of the week and delves a bit more in depth with history and further context that I do not receive in the brief snippets I watch on the news or read online. I do admit, I miss their old team during the presidential race. That seemed more informative whereas the new format is a bit more ""light"" and informal. That is the only reason I give it 4 stars out of 5. Their old team I truly can say was completely factual and devoid of bias. The new way sometimes jokes a bit which always reveals a slight his. Overall though I feel like it is a very unbiased and nonpartisan podcast on today's news. Keep with the facts NPR, you're doing great! I know I have been able to count on you to provide little to no bias in your reporting.",4,"Politics"

Tamara Keith sounds like Lena Dunham's evil twin, which is disconcerting. If this were a bunch of amateur college radio DJs arguing over who were better, Television or The Strokes, I could handle it, but for incisive analysis of today's grievous political situation, it hardly seems appropriate. We need more informed journalism, not more people sitting around bloviating. ""We're so millennial and we are so totally like going to explain the news to you"" gets real old fast.",2,"Politics"

"832","Very informative, and I really like the commentators",2017-05-07,"Gumpster2010","It's hard and overwhelming to take in the full news cycle every week, especially from the more serious news sources... it's easy to be upset by NYT headlines or whatever 24-7 punditry is happening on the TV news outlets.

For me, this podcast, with its upbeat tone and personality, is a welcome and digestible way for me to understand what's happening in Washington and what it means.

Lately this podcast has been covering more of the minutiae of the Trump presidency such as his tweets and who is up and who is down among the Whitehouse staff. Furthermore the analysis of what they cover is just not smart, insightful or helpful. It's becoming the Politico of political podcasts. Sometimes worth a listen but mostly noise from talking heads.

For the most part, I feel the NPR Roundup and Political podcasts meet these requirements. My only complaint is with Mara. She is SO combative when speaking about President Trump. It is this kind of reporting that I find distasteful. I don't mind a hit of personal political opinion to seep into a discussion, but she is just over the top. Whatever information she is trying to impart to me is lost in her angry and combative tone. I find myself fast forwarding through her contributions. This is a shame. I feel she could be a wonderful contributor, if there was less of an antagonistic tone to her reporting. I do love NPR, and all the work done for local radio and podcasts.",4,"Politics"

If you like that stuff, if you like the pop-culture of politics styled news media, this will be right up your alley. I think that this podcast successfully hits the highlights with snarky sarcasm, but to think that the npr politics podcast could be unbiased or more inclusive of other narratives than the typical left wing opinion is simply too much to ask I guess.

Since then, the correspondents' forced normalization of the current administration's actions force me to find another news source.

I will continue to listen to it as long as I can get past the snarky, smug little laughs that constantly come from the ladies in particular. You might think that all the laughing and giggling they did about GOP losing and then being so wrong would have knocked them off their high horses a bit, but it's not so. They really act like they have 100% knowledge of everything and Trump is just a fool. And while I get that, because he behaves like an idiot far too often, perhaps the hosts need take their job more seriously and start looking at things a little more intricately.",3,"Politics"

"1147","Who is this for?",2017-01-29,"liamdonovan18","For some reason the hosts seem much more interested in discussing pop culture and sharing the latest Twitter jokes and giving us the news. This should be apparent by the fact that there is an entire segment dedicated to discussing things that have nothing to do with politics. I suppose this is done to attract young listeners, but then aren't we younger listeners already in that loop anyway? What the podcast comes down to, then, is several intelligent hosts trying as hard as possible to avoid intelligent discussion in order to appeal to an audience that isn't listening. No one is listening to the NPR Politics Podcast to get takes on pop culture from those who were hired to discuss politics. At that point I'd rather listen to a genuine pop culture podcast, not some confused amalgam.",1,"Politics"

How much more should Obama bend over?? Sam, you have more venom for a pop star than you do the barbarian at the gate. I can't do it anymore.

It is a disservice to listeners and a threat to the very nature of journalism. At a time when journalistic strength is more important than ever, the casual unfunny yuk-fest that the hosts perpetually descend into undermines any message therein, even if the message is simply supposed to be ""here's the truth."" Sanders's ""aw shucks"" mentality and his (faux?) naivete are increasingly unbearable, and glamorize a culture that keeps education at a distance. Ron Elving and 1 or 2 others are the only reason I kept coming back, but I am now done with these dishrags.

Uses multiple host to all agree with eachother to attempt to boost their false credibility. Yeah, if you are wanting to get confirmation bias as a liberal in not know what's really going on, this would be for you. However, if you are looking for journalist, move along, you wont find them hear. This podcast seeks to drown out negative information about Democrats and even gets their talking points from Democrat opperatives Twitter feed. If you listen to this, you would probably be surprised by the vary predictable victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 election and think it was an upset when in reality anyone paying attention knew he was clearly going to win months before the election. It your goal is to be well informed, this is not the podcast you want to listen to. NPR only reinforces the eco chamber that had so many ignorant on what was really going on.

I consider myself as an indepenant with moderate views leaning a little more the the right and so what I am looking for is a politics podcast that has discussions on current events in politics from different angles. I thought that National Public Radio would give me views from the right, left, and center with thoughtful, intelligent, and curtious debates. There are views from the left and center but no right leaning opinions which i think would be a great addition not only to hear their views but to see were both sides can come to an agreemant on the important issues. I believe a big part of the reason that republicans and democrats have such animosity is because people today have so many options today that people just go to places they can listen to their own views instead of hearing what the other side have to say as well.",3,"Politics"

For example, in The First Presidential Debate episode, Ron Elving says (minutes 16-17) that he's amazed that Republicans have been able to be elected in communities of color by spreading ""A Republican message""--implying that the Republican platform is implicitly racist. They also honed in on all of the erronous facts that Donald Trump cited during the debate, but failed to call out ""let's look at the facts"" Hillary for also living in her own reality, as she claimed that Russian Intelligence hacked into the Democratic e-mails, a claim that's obviously been suggested but really is conspiratorial.",1,"Politics"

I remember exactly where I was when I first listened to the Beta version of the podcast on What's the Point? I appreciate their way of telling stories where data drives the narrative rather than just decorates it. I appreciate how cleanly they are willing to say they were wrong about a predictive mistake and investigate their own biases.

"1843","These ""journalists"" seem to lack perspective.",2016-09-23,"Chicot28","As a person of color listening to this podcast, I have to say that the only perspective they seem to promote is that of middle aged white baby boomers. Hiring a racially diverse group to basically spout out the same nonsense that appeals to upper middle class white baby boomers does not change this. These reporters sound like they are living in a DC press bubble and seem to be handed quotes straight from the HRC campaign (without fact checking any of it). At times the podcast can sound like straight up propaganda. You guys are doing a disservice to your audience hoping to keep your access to HRC and the powerful in DC. There is real economic strife in this country and all we hear about is the horse race. The couple of reporters of color in this podcast have missed so many opportunities to educate the listeners, preferring instead to promote a particular candidate. Sam Sanders should just go work for the Clinton campaign because he straight up sounds like he is getting paid by them (BTW, completely ignoring why millennials of color are not as enthusiastic about Clinton). Asma Khalid is the only saving grace of this podcast. This is specially true of her on the ground reporting segments where she talks to real people. Please try to do more reporting like Ms. Khalid and please NPR try to find young journalists of color who are doing good work and not just that one kid who went to school with your son at Harvard. I have resorted to listening to BBC and The Guardian podcasts dealing with U.S elections. Your content can sound amusingly superficial at times and that would be great if our current political situation was not as grave as it is. What you are missing seems to be diversity of perspectives. Half of the time most of your hosts/guests agree on most topics and those are the same things the DC press Corp agrees on and the same thing CNN and MSNBC agree on making you just part of the ""mainstream media"" NPR purports to be morally above.

I look forward to each weekly episode and love the ad hoc episodes (especially the ones about musicals and politics and food and politics). The topics are timely and covered excellently (but that's to be expected withh NPR) but the best part is the casual and witty repartee with the correspondents and reporters. They make these episodes so funny and entertaining. I did not expect that from NPR! Politics on TV are too much about talking heads and people screaming past each other. Here the participants enjoy their discussion, even when they don't all agree, and genuinely seem to like and respect each other. A refreshing change from the usual political coverage. Keep up the good work!",5,"Politics"

It is biased and is not devoid of opinion on the candidates without even giving opinion on ALL of them. Another news source stuck in the duopoly of the political system. The media could make this country great but for some reason, the media no longer trusts the average citizen to make an informed decision on facts. Media like NPR Politics attempts to sway the listener, but in doing so, they've either polarized people on issues that are truly debatable to a reasonable human...or drive them elsewhere for news. Unfortunately, we are losing places to turn to. **Please bring the old NPR politics back where you inform and allow us to make our own decisions based on fact, NOT your individual sentiments in the matter.**",1,"Politics"

"1988","Big letdown this election season",2016-08-21,"Stagmania","I was initially very excited to find this podcast as the 2016 presidential primary was winding down. Featuring a rotating panel of bright, informed and interesting reporters, it gave a quick but thorough overview of each week in the election cycle, and t was funny too! As we've moved into the general election, however, I can't ignore the obvious and irresponsible effort to normalize Trump and treat his campaign with kid gloves, while simultaneously holding Clinton and her campaign to a much higher level of scrutiny. In recent weeks, they've gone so far as to ""interpret"" Trump's words for him to downplay his missteps, and engaged in outright speculation on mistakes Clinton might have made that there is no actual evidence for. I'm not sure if this is straight up bias against Clinton or simply a misguided attempt at ""balance"", but it has seriously diminished the integrity of this news organization in my eyes. They've lost me as a listener, and I can only hope their audience is not relying on them as a sole source of information during this critically important election.",2,"Politics"

It's wonderful to hear their banter, wittiness, and perspectives and get to know more of their personalities and styles. It has made me enjoy their reporting on ATC and Morning Edition even more.

"2007","Please, someone, but a muzzle on Sam Sanders",2016-08-12,"BoulderTrip","The program has pretty good content. I've been listening for several months, but am on the verge of stopping. The primary problem is Sam Sanders and his need to constantly interrupt and step on his colleagues points. For some reason, Sam seems to believe they're not making their points correctly and only his interruptions and amplifications will make the information digestible. Some of his points might be worthwhile to make - after his colleague has finished speaking. Tamara Keith does a bit of this too, but she can't hold a candle to Sam's rate of interruption and talkovers. What a breath of fresh air the August 1st and August 11th podcasts were - no Sam Sanders interruptions! Going forward I think I will turn off the automatic download for this podcast and only download when Sam Sanders is on vacation.",4,"Politics"

I trust what they say is true. They strive to be unbiased. I am not a journalist so I am biased. When they discuss points of view contrary to mine, I cringe internally. However I LOVE it because it's good for me to hear the other side plus it is more proof to me they are presenting all sides of the argument and withholding their bias.

I'm older and truly curious to know if this is a targeted effort, and are millennials really responsive to same? My guess is most of us, of any age, are already NPR listeners.

"2146","Boring and Repetitive",2016-07-14,"intrepidpeanut","When it comes to solid political journalism, it tends to be very rare. So when I discovered that NPR had created a politics podcast, I was ecstatic! After listening to this podcast for a few months, I've become absolutely disgusted by it. Every week, they manage to cover the same aspects of the presidential campaign over and over again. It's either sucking up to Hillary or talking about something crazy Trump did recently. Whenever they don't talk about the campaign, it's something that's been blowing up all over the news (Newsflash, I don't live under a rock). When I discovered this podcast, I'd hope that I would gain insightful views on important political issues and up to date coverage on all aspects of the political system; bills debated in congress, decisions in the judicial system, executive actions, etc. However, this podcast falls short of these expectations by a long shot.

Hearing the journalists in this show discuss political issues is like getting to be a fly on the wall of a presidential cabinet meeting. It's always exciting to see professionals at the top of their game interacting with each other. Some of the off topic banter is a little annoying since I don't actually care who is the biggest Beyonce fan.

It's not often that you hear a reporter cry on air, let alone be so distraught that his voice continues to shake until the end of the segment. I think this is a thoughtful, articulate, and savvy group of political reporters any day. However, Sam Sanders' remarks about the ""safe places"" that exist uniquely in marginalized communities, such as the black church, gay bars, etc., are there because normal, every day spaces are not always safe for us, were particularly perceptive and demonstrated raw and unabashed empathy that I was grateful to hear from a profession that is unbiased by nature. Even-handed, accurate, and well-researched news does not have to be devoid of the emotions one experiences when reporting on highly charged events. Considering that it was an NPR story about the Orlando shooting that finally allowed me to cry this morning, it seems appropriate that I end my day listening to one of my new favorite voices prove that he truly does see the lives on which he reports.

The reporting and analysis are always good. I rarely learn anything new here (with the exception of the existence of Hillary-inspired wine ice cream!), but I enjoy the coffee-shop feel of the discussion, and the lively personalities of the reporters shine through in a way they just can't in NPR reporting.

This last weekly roundup (June 16th, 2016) was a concerning regression. They were completely off on saying the democrats are united by citing Obama and Hillary being on the same message with no mention of Bernie Sanders and his supporters' reluctance to come to the Hillary camp. Following that, mocking Republican rules for replacing a dropped out candidate by pointing out the amont of text on the Republican rules sheet versus that of the Democrats' was immature and out of line.

I have to echo other reviewers that this seems geared toward a younger and inexperienced audience. It's almost like an effort to teach politics 101 by some smart millennials. There's just no meat to this thing. Sam Sanders bizarrely adopts this affectation of not knowing anything about anything in the service of impartiality. This forces the remedial 6th grade feel of the podcast and by explaining topics like whitewater that are nonsense in the current context, they end up lending credence to things that aren't equivalents. Very frustrating. It's a tangible relief when an older correspondent is there to add some substance and context and not just engage in bland chatter.",2,"Politics"

Ken Rudin and Ron Elving had the perfect balance of intellectual heft, history and insight on the week‚Äôs political news. The current version feels a bit more like Slate‚Äôs awful Political Gabfest. Everyone is just a little too perky and the substance often takes a back seat to the personality of who ever happens to be talking. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt let it go‚Äù really should go. I really don‚Äôt need to know who likes Beyonce or who‚Äôs obsessed with what. I get it: it‚Äôs light and makes the hosts accessible, but I don‚Äôt listen to political podcasts (or NPR, for that matter) to hang out with neato kids; I listen to them to learn stuff from people who have access to information I don‚Äôt have. Maybe I‚Äôm getting too old for this show, but at a young 50, if I‚Äôm already too old for the show, maybe the show is too young for an informed audience. I haven‚Äôt given up hope yet.

The group of regulars have a great vibe together and I like that their combination of analysis and conversation is pretty consistently lighthearted; most other news sources dip with regularity into a much more negative tone and I appreciate that the podcast stays away from that. I started listening a few months ago for their US presidential election coverage, but if I have any criticism it would be about that very election coverage. Specifically, it seems that the election is actually the only thing they‚Äôve been covering. They did break off for an episode or two to discuss the Supreme Court situation (Scalia‚Äôs death, what it means, etc) but routinely brought that back to its relation to the presidential race. That being said it‚Äôs still an excellent podcast and I do recommend it.",4,"Politics"

"2465","Eh...",2016-03-27,"That Demmed Pimpernel","This show is designed to reflect NPR's trend toward millenials. The complaints of bias are a overboiled, but the show reflects millenials feelings and worldview. It isn't bad, but the vast majority of the show demonstrates the reporters relative lack of experience. They are knowledgeable enough, but don't have a very comprehensive view. I am the same age as them and often seem to remember things from way farther back than them! I started listening to Ken Rudin and Ron Elving's It's All Politics and was very sad when it was canceled. Ken and Ron had a deep and intimate knowledge of politics and brought a lot of persepective and depth to the often two dimensional world of political analysis. Unfortunately when Ron makes his few appearences on the show rather than upping their game, the team tends to view him as the ""grandpa"" whose insight is outdated and irrelevent. The show tends to devolve into a coffee shop discussion with reporters who are engaged but know another beat is coming up and don't want to be too attached.",3,"Politics"

To have to ask Ron what year Goldwater was on the ballot is embarrassing for everyone involved, especially coming from NPR.

One, it's fun to get to know the NPR personalities, it's more relaxed than radio so it has a lighter banter. Two it feels like you are behind the scenes, you get a real sense of the press conferences, debates etc. And finally, they tell you what you need to know-predictions, what if scenarios, what to look forward to. It's the best and I <3 Sam Sanders.",5,"Politics"

"2535","Great show",2016-03-08,"A 30 year old Chicagoan","I've really enjoyed this podcast since I subscribed a couple months ago. They cover the big topics and do a nice job of explaining things like caucuses and super delegates, but also touch on the silly aspects of the campaign like Marco Rubio's footwear and the trending topic of Ted Cruz as the zodiac killer. I enjoy the balance and I learn something new each episode. If you listen to tons of politics podcasts, perhaps you won't find anything new here aside from a more relaxed style. I basically listen to this and whatever coverage NPR plays while I'm in the car, and that's plenty of election coverage for me. Thank you NPR politics podcast for helping me feel informed and for bringing some lightness and humor to a pretty crazy election year.",5,"Politics"

It was a fun podcast and I enjoyed listening to it. I like this one even better, because it includes a more diverse set of perspectives from a larger collection of NPRs political reporting team.

Frankly, I am insulted by how dumbed-down and low-brow this podcast is at times. The NPR Politics podcast is seriously doing a disservice to NPR listeners.",2,"Politics"

I like npr politics, but it feels more like everything else out there - just a bunch of talking heads stating their opinions - rather than an education in things that have happened over the last several decades in electoral politics, reminders of what's different and what's not, highlighting remarkable parallels to candidates past.

If this is a posture, meant to be some kind of audience stand-in, we don't need one. And if this ""aw shucks can you explain this to me"" stance is for real, I cannot understand his high profile in this podcast or the coverage of the election.

"2651","Wish it dug deeper...",2016-02-21,"JimFishman","I think this podcast skews a little young/hipster-ish. I am late 30s and have listened to NPR for 15+ years, so perhaps I am aging out of the demographic they‚Äôre after here. I used to listen to the previous host, Ken Rudin, on Neal Conan‚Äôs show, and I felt his trivia and humor skewed a little old for me‚Ä¶so I am just Goldilocks looking for a political podcast. I prefer the more thoughtful, in depth news analysis that Tom Ashbrook offers on On Point‚Äôs Friday ‚ÄúWeek in the News‚Äù segment, and I just found KCRW's ‚ÄúLeft, Right, and Center‚Äù thanks to another review of this show. The jokey chit chat in this pod cast and it‚Äôs brevity just leave me wanting.",3,"Politics"

"2654","An Informative, Quick, Useful Hodgepodge",2016-02-21,"TObenauf","A self-professed political junkie, I often struggle to find a podcast or outlet to be able to discuss political going-ons. This podcast is an amazing outlet for me to do that - they analyze everything of importance, but they don‚Äôt overanalyze and they don‚Äôt force viewpoints on the listeners. The entire ‚Äúcast‚Äù has a great rapport with one another and that allows for a light-hearted, but spirited debate. Keep up the good work everyone!",5,"Politics"

This podcast has allowed me to ease into this new area of my life and I'm actually enjoying it...something I'm surprised to be able to say. It's nice to be able to engage in political conversations with friends and know what the heck I'm talking about. If I had one criticism it's in the sound mixing. Of all the podcasts to which I subscribe, this one is recorded the lowest. I have to turn up the volume so loud that when This American Life or another comes on it blasts through my speakers.

"2662","Has promise",2016-02-22,"mhodgins","While I do enjoy this podcast, it feels much less than it could be. Most of the hosts (particularly the main guy) seem far too inexperienced and don't offer any real insight. The seems more like a few friends having a chat rather than a serious show. I miss the old version.",3,"Politics"
"2663","Strongly biased",2016-02-22,"Saraj97","I used to love this podcast, particularly when Ken Rudin was still on it. I was really excited to see that it was back, but it's proving disappointing. With each passing episode, the commentators' opinions about who will win the nominations is becoming more and more obviously biased, while being posited as fact. Newsflash- there are no forgone conclusions in either race. NPR Politics apparently fancies itself a kingmaker. I've unsubscribed.",1,"Politics"

"2666","Love it, but could diversify a bit",2016-02-22,"Arielska","I love this podcast - the coverage and the hosts - it's really been engaging for me to listen. That said, I wish it was more objective or that republican-leaning speakers were brought in a guest because the casual nature of the podcast does allow the positions of the reporters to seep through.

"2668","Something‚Äôs being wasted.",2016-02-22,"Quinn Souther","I‚Äôve been a consistent listener for a few months now, and I‚Äôve given my opinion of the podcast enough time to develop. I had high hopes for the NPR Politics Podcast, but it falls well short of the rest of NPR‚Äôs slate of radio and podcast programming, and comes out especially disappointing for its shallowness and relative surface-skimming of the topics covered.",3,"Politics"
"2669","Keep up the good work",2016-02-22,"MandaAnne","Love this podcast!! Wish I could have even more. I feel informed without having to consume TV and other sensationalist media news.

"2683","Best. Podcast. EVER!",2016-02-20,"ChupiMama","Two questions/remarks though:
1. Why does everyone at NPR mispronounce Nevada? (first A should have ‚Äúahhh‚Äù sound)
2. Why did you give Trump a pass when he called the Pope disgraceful. No one called him out for insulting the leader of the Catholic church. All conversation focused on the wall, not his being a Protestant insulting the Catholic leader. It‚Äôs odd to me.",5,"Politics"

The ""can't let it go"" feature where they dig up the political story they are thinking about is great.I would listen to Sam Sanders and Tamara Keith all day- maybe they could tag team replace Diane R when she steps down?

Yeah, maybe go somewhere else. But if you want something that will keep you entertained while keeping you informed? You're in the right place. It's enjoyable and easy to listen to, and a great place to get your political headlines for the week. They give enough detail that you can investigate on your own for nuances, but keep things simple enough that I still pay attention (and therefore learn about!) things I typically wouldn't.

"2826","Best and Worst of NPR",2016-02-13,"Mr. Macleay","I both love it, and I hate it. For context, I listen to every episode, and I listen to NPR and the BBC pretty much every day. I can't help myself, I read most articles that discuss the election when I see them. There are a few of the journalists on this podcast who can't seem to stop themselves from interrupting each other, they honestly sound like the college students who always put their hands up in class and never notice they're not leaving any room for other people to talk. It's like they're always trying to beat each other to the punchline, or finish the sentence of their colleague. That, and a solid 5 to 10 percent of the podcast is dedicated to them giggling. Now, they are having a good time and I'm not trying to fault them for it, I just don't find it as charming as they seem to. Those criticisms aside, they're all very, very smart and I often find I have learned something or thought about something in a different way due to their discussion, and for all my complaining I will keep listening.",3,"Politics"

One of the podcasts I can't wait to listen to is THIS one. The NPR Politics podcast gives you the need-to-know information about the current state of the 2016 presidential election, providing details that you wouldn't discover scrolling through your usual social media news feeds. The reporters are clearly knowledgable and possess great personalities to provide different perspectives, resulting in an on-track conversation that you can relate to.

Each of the contributors brings something different to the table, and it's a great way to get a fresh take on the news. Sam Sanders is hilarious and obviously very smart, but always has a youthful perspective. Love hearing Domenico Montanaro's seasoned take on the news, as a reporter who knows presidential campaigns inside and out - as a fellow New Yorker, I also enjoy his thinly veiled sarcasm. Tamara Keith and Asma Khalid are also fantastic. Love the ""can't let it go"" segment that closes each episode - wish episodes could be put out daily!",5,"Politics"

I have been thoroughly enjoying this new podcast since it came out and it makes me feel at least 70% more informed.

It seems they've already endorsed Hillary as the Democratic presidential candidate. Very little talk about Bernie Sanders and when they do it's very dismissive. None about O'Malley or his platform. So I guess if your voting in the republican primary and voting republican, or already know Clinton is you girl then this is the perfect podcast for you.

"2936","Coffee Table Politics",2015-12-09,"1996e","I've listened to this show past the Terror Attacks episode and the podcast seems really jumbled. They all seem to want to get what they want to say in and we're hearing a recorded conversation of that. However, it doesn't seem to be fact-checked and contains no more intuition or insight than a normal news article. Example: Bernie Sanders seemed uncomfortable with foreign policy questions and they ""heard"" that the team behind Bernie Sanders was against CBS including more foreign policy questions. There were more conjectures, thoughts, a random analogy, but no source was named. For all we know, that could be a rumor. I'll have to read a news article to know, which nullifies the point of this podcast. Another example: Ted Cruz. They talked about Obama criticizing about how ""someone"" wanted to close the doors to Syrian refugees and that was disappointing after all America had done to welcome that family/person. Well, they pointed out that Obama didn't name him specifically, so how did they know it was him? Maybe they have insider info and could tell us more details, but I suppose I'll have to look up more articles to know. This podcast was created to inform on politics but it seems to be spreading rumors and not news. They've only attacked candidates, not explained what their stance on issues is. I haven't learned anything and I listened up to the Weekly Roundup of Tuesday November before I couldn't take it anymore.",2,"Politics"

Ken and Ron felt like two old journalists that had seen everything and could give an objective/light hearted take on the situation. This is not that. This feels like a group of moderately liberal, political enthusiasts at a coffee shop having a good time. Instead of objectivity, we can hear the bias slip through. Hilary Clinton's issues are talked about with sadness, sadness at her failure to be a better candidate. While Rubio is talked about as an idiot for claiming a philosophy degree makes less than a welder. Ron attempts to talk about it objectively but one person can only bring so much objectivity to an amateur journalist chat.

Has the legacy of Walter Lippmann been so eroded by time that we are only left this juvinalia of patter song political thought?

"2976","Avoid if you're seeking unbiased discussion",2015-11-13,"JDPerson1","After having high hopes for this podcast, I was disappointed from the get-go to discover just how much of a liberal tilt it had. In the first five minutes alone, one of the hosts matter-of-factly claimed that Marco Rubio lied in saying welders make more than philosophers. Her evidence? Philosophy professors make more than welders according to the BLS. Ironically enough, the speaker was a philosophy major (in the wide sense of the word, a philosopher) but somehow thought only professors were philosophers. Not a single co-host pushed back on her outlandish conclusion to point out that it's a little more difficult than that to know if what Rubio said is true. The rest of the conversation was more of the same. Slate's political podcast is more neutral, so I'll be sticking to it and Ricochet.",2,"Politics"

The topic was that she and other girls of color were being treated differently in relation to the dress code. The host‚Äôs response was patronizing. Instead of following the point, he asked her if she can understand the perspective of a father trying to protect his daughter from (xyz-fill in the sexist and limiting fear story,) which had nothing to do with what the girl was describing.

When the poor guest finally gets a chance to talk, he or she will blurt out a whole bunch of stuff, because it is a rare opportunity to talk. There is no flow. Instead of saying (as Diane did), ""Short break, right back,"" you will get instead a repetition of the guests' names and titles, a listener question to be answered after the break, then you get a break, and then after the break you get the same question you got before the break---plus Joshua's take on the question.

BUT today I listened to FEBRUARY 20, 2018 ""The Future of Humanity"" with Michio Kaku. Why did you let this lunatic carry on for the whole show without any counterpoint of rationality? Futurists are not in the business of building rational scenarios. They make stuff up, but it entertains people and so they can make a living selling books. I am a Mechanical Engineering professor working on energy transition and I have to deal with the real world 100% of the time. I don't know how to express to you how cringe worthy your coverage of this Futurist was because you presented him as an actual scientist or technology expert which he is not. Maybe you need to explore the whole genre of Futurism and see what it really is. It is entertainment, like science fiction.",4,"1A"

I really appreciate the variety of topics ‚Äî including (as NPR is beloved for generally) topics I never would have sought out on my own or known I should care about.

However, I have to take off a star in response to today's episode on the necessity of supplements. Not 5 minutes in, Joshua Johnson pauses the discussion to play a clip from Aziz Ansari's Master of None about working out/body image, no mention of supplements. You would think with the dialogue around Ansari and the MeToo movement, the inclusion of the clip would have been more thought out, especially as there are many other (and perhaps more relevant) pop culture references to body obsession that could have been used.

Why?? For those who can't listen live (which is a large majority of the population) downloading them is super convenient, why wouldn't you want all of your content readily available?

Joshua Johnson has increasingly found his voice, which is funny, passionate, and driven to excel. And in finding his voice, he has found me as a devoted listener.

"3155","Amature",2018-01-03,"Lefkalc","Joshua talks to his audience as if they are stupid. He talks so slow and disconnected and he breaks things down far too much it implies that the listeners intelligence is that of an elementary school student. He also leaves no mystery to radio; saying things like, we‚Äôre going to break in a minute, or I know we have to break in a minute, really bursts the magic of radio. The listener has no idea of this break, so don‚Äôt give it away. Joshua also does not let his guests have the limelight. The show is about the topic and not the host. He also silences his guests mics so they can‚Äôt jump in. Often the guests are far more knowledgeable about the topic than the host, don‚Äôt stifle that intelligence! Sometimes I listen and think, wow this guest is at the top of his/her field and I am not able to hear a full thought by this guest because Joshua keeps interrupting and redirecting the topic and often tossing to another guest. I can only assume that he is insecure about the topic or intelligence that he can‚Äôt keep up. It‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt know everything the guest knows, that‚Äôs why you have a guest. I really hope you‚Äôre able to take the comments with a grain of salt since it‚Äôs been a long time coming for me to write his review. A lot of this can be fixed by taking a deep breath and relaxing before the interview. Talk less, interrupt less and have more faith in yourself and the show. The host is nervous and it shows.",2,"1A"

Well, after many months of listening, I can sincerely say that Monsieur Johnson is indeed a most talented and astute moderator with a wealth of knowledge of his captivating topics and high-quality guests.

Compared to Rehm‚Äôs show, 1A thus far appears to be more focused on race, gender, and identity, and to be pitched toward a younger audience. Particularly recommended is the Friday News Roundup, a single 1.5-hour file that is split between domestic and international news, each with a panel of three invited journalists.",5,"1A"
"3203","The most relevant news show",2017-06-22,"Amihatt","I love that 1A focuses on the bigger issues behind the news.

I appreciate that 1A always has at least one woman on the panel, but I do wish the panelists talked about the role of race and gender in every issue a little more.

He's so good you don't even notice how good he is ... other hosts have techniques for tapering off one caller, pitching to a panelist or interviewee, etc. With Johnson, you don't even see the mechanics, you just flow along an interesting and informative stream of conversation.

I was hopeful, but am now disappointed by the replacement show 1A. I am a woman of color and was excited to hear a potentially multicultural viewpoint on a national news show. I've found Mr. Johnson to be gullible in that he allows utter falsehoods to go unchecked on the air. For example, on a news roundup early in the Trump presidency, a reporter guest said that Trump was focusing his deportations on ""bad hombres,"" when there was already clear evidence all over the news that non-criminal immigrant workers and parents were being deported. Mr. Johnson let that falsehood stand unchecked.",1,"1A"

I can't listen to the show live so I depend on the podcasts. I am getting use to his style and I do understand that live callers ""waste time"" with their complements, too bad it's all the bottom line now. One more point, I don't understand why on Fridays they don't post both hours of the politic hour. Doesn't management understand the power Diane had in DC.

While I understand that 1A, like the DR show is fundamentally a DC based radio program, your larger audience is and will continue to be podcast listeners.

This especially includes both the domestic AND International hours of the Friday news roundup. It's completely essential. Without this you will lose listeners, and there is no logical reason not to offer this. National listeners aren't going to be willing to listen partially through their podcast app and partially from the 1A website, just to get the whole programs.

There are also others like the one about the explanatory comma. I enjoyed that one and didn't really think much about it and was surprised to hear how much some people felt strongly against it. It's really helpful when this kind of information is shared because even though it can be somewhat jarring to hear about backlash to something you don't think is controversial AT ALL, it helps you understand where others are coming from though this is also in large part to a great production team.

Some of the episodes are really rewarding and shed light on perspectives that don‚Äôt get much airtime on traditional media outlets. I loved the stories about whiteness, the series following the school for black boys in DC, and the many segments about the immigrant experience. I don‚Äôt subscribe to the podcast anymore, however, because a few too many episodes were too upsetting. One that immediately comes to mind had a segment comparing sound advice regarding sharing expenses based on actual finances to a cynical take on restorative justice (in my opinion) where the white partner has to pay more as some sort of white tax. More upsetting, the episode on Civil War monuments presented a ‚Äúhe said/she said‚Äù narrative comparing an opinion based on the actual history of the Civil War to one steeped in the Lost Cause narrative ‚Äî the latter being a widely discredited attempt at historical revisionism that occludes the true motivations of the war. Some of the statements the source said ‚Äî that the Civil War was not about slavery but conflict between Northern English Americans versus Southern Scotch-Irish Americans ‚Äî were just clearly untrue and I don‚Äôt understand how the producers didn‚Äôt catch that.",3,"CodeSwitch"

I‚Äôm not sure I would never claim to be woke as a state of being but after listening to the ‚ÄúR-word in the age of Trump‚Äù episode I‚Äôm a little less sleepy now. Hearing racism discussed in terms of harm versus character, defining where terms like bigotry and stereotype exist in relation to each other, and how racial language creates tough questions in this age of journalism was really...intense? Powerful? I can‚Äôt find the right word to encompass the fact that I kept rewinding this episode over and over to hear it again. I feel better equipped to understand, discuss, and identify racism and racial animus than I was yesterday in a way that fundamentally changes the conversation for me. I admit that it had never occurred to me that using racism as a descriptor of a perpetrators character without discussing the context of harm was itself racist.

Now, a couple of years later, it is by far one of my all-time favorite podcasts. I listen to some podcasts (S-town, Ted Radio Hour, On Being, Harry Potter and the Sacred Text) for entertainment, but Code Switch actually helps me be a better dad, better American, better world citizen, and a better human. Yes, sometimes it's challenging and uncomfortable, and sometimes I even sob uncontrollably when I'm confronted with something especially hard. Plus, the hosts are just phenomenal.

As someone who learned the term code switch when I was a white teacher in an all black school in DC, I am personally very passionate about the importance of being able to authentically and safely exist in various spaces in our society. (No, it was not TFA. I was not ""assigned"" to this school. This was a job I chose and loved.) For me, it meant valuing and respecting my new community in the same way I would any new culture in which I chose to live. Learning the language, the customs, the history, and the value system. For my job as a teacher, to get linguistically nerdy, that meant I taught my students that learning standard American English (SAE) was about adding a language to their fluency in black english vernacular (BEV) while also learning about and honoring the beauty and rich history and importance of BEV. I wanted them to learn the skill of code switching without internalizing the linguistic and cultural oppression society tries to put on them.",5,"CodeSwitch"

"3781","Ignore 1 star comments",2017-03-07,"Nietzsche-Preacher","This was a very enlightening podcast. Most of the 1 star reviews are from people who listened to 1 podcast, saw the words ""white people"" and racial fragility made them give it one star without even listening. Very weird, as Code Switch routinely has White people delicately speak on their first hand account of whiteness and performances of it, but still other white identifying people erupt. Compare that to the 400 years media-based of racial essentialism and disparagement by members of the majority yet POC only remonstrate this much if someone says racial slurs, not just say the word ""Asian"", ""black"", etc. Also, I see a few POC giving it low stars because it's racialized. Sad. Robin DeAngelo is a genius because she crafted a theory of social defensiveness (""white fragility"") that is applicable to all raced and sexed categories. That is, some POC exhibit more fragility (usually white fragility) than white-identified people themselves. Listen to Code Switch so that you can deconstruct race and stop letting it govern your life. Racism exist. See? I said and didn't spontaneously combust.",5,"CodeSwitch"
"3782","Cult of Victimhood",2017-03-09,"WhiskeyKnight","So on the latest episode there was a panel discussion on ""allyship."" The women on the panel proceeded to disparage the motives of their white friends and allies for a solid half hour. One women even claimed that white people cannot even be allies to PoC, because doing so only reinforces their privilege. These kind of moral purity tests could not be more uncharitable and self defeating. I can't imagine going about my life with this level of suspicion and resentment towards my fellow human beings. The people on this panel may indeed be victims of societal oppression. But more than that, they're victims of their own cynicism.",1,"CodeSwitch"

Where is your reflection on that? - (on Black Oscar ep) FACT is:Van Jones went on and interviewed AA that voted for 45.

When topics come up that make me feel confused or uncomfortable, it encourages me to interrogate *why* I'm uncomfortable or research so I'm no longer confused.

The conversation is between individuals who identify as people of color, but I would reiterate one listener email which said that it doesn't feel like everyone is invited into the conversation. The hosts have a tendency to reflect on their experiences against a backdrop of white interpretation but leave a lot on the table in regards to interpretations of various ethnic groups by other groups. Or how about addressing the sliding scale of cultural awareness? I'd like for there to be white participant in the conversation as well as maybe a person openly acknowledging that they don't fit the mold of their skin color.

According to NPR audience demographics listed on their site, they have an overwhelming listener base of wealth whites living in affluent cities and suburbs. This particular program is clearly market to their main demographic as well as affluent POCs living in mostly white areas. Their views on the reality most white people experience can easily be disproven if you have ever ventured an hours drive out of your major city. They have no problem trying to tell you about your own life experiences but would be all to quick to call you a racist if you did the same. They have this notion that white people are uncomfortable talking about race. I have to agree, but this is because it is not a conversation. We are expected to listen to how horrible we are and when we bring up a time a crime was committed against us that we felt was due to the color of our skin, we get labeled a racist. This podcast only focuses on how white wrong other races and never tackles bigotry between ethnic groups other than whites.

This podcast is done in such a way that it feels both educational and relatable, meaning it brings to light issues that are necessary for white America to listen to and develop a greater understanding of, while, it seems, also being something that people of color can listen to and feel as though their opinions, thoughts and voices are being represented. As a white woman married to a man of color (specifically a black man), and who volunteers with a social justice organization where I am inside California prisons, serving predominantly populations of color, it is always valuable for me to hear direct, honest perspectives and experiences from people of color.

However, for the ones that are not good (and I listen through the whole thing waiting for it to get better and usually end up disappointed), I feel that the commonality they have is that it sounds like the people are just venting. Some examples of this is the episode on people not saying names correctly and the ""Guide to handling casual racism.""

The 1st ep. was surprisingly mediocre for an NPR show but I listened to a few to give it a chance and they only seemed to get worse. I felt like I was watching a cable-access show of NPR interns talking about their opinions, with very little research or facts offered. The hosts are not particularly informative, entertaining or interesting and it sounds like a bunch of 23 yr olds who think they're informed but are just spouting off subjective opinions, and know very little about life, but are narcissistic enough to think it's compelling. Do us a favor and put them back at research desks and let them learn and 'earn' their way up rather then handing some young-uns a podcast so NPR seems more diverse. I learn more by listening to 2 Dope Queens AND I get a laugh. There has to be more compelling AND experienced diverse voices out there. Give them a shot.",2,"CodeSwitch"

These stories are welcome because they remind me of my identity, especially since it's so difficult to talk about these topics when you have non-communicative, first generation parents. I even had to wipe away some tears during the letter read by the Vietnamese girl in an attempt to explain her support for the black lives matter movement to her first generation father.

The hosts are likable and don't pretend to have all the answers. However, that's what's often most frustrating: the episode concludes with the hosts admitting they don't have answers to our current problems and while that's fair, it somewhat mitigates the point of the podcast.

This isn't a bad thing, I just think it's better to not mislead in the description & own it. people will listen no matter what because it's an NPR podcast, but i just wanted to comment because while I don't disagree with the views represented, I think they had a platform to engage a broader audience & establish a more ""balanced"", realistic dialogue focused on making progress & missed that opportunity..",2,"CodeSwitch"

It needs to keep a somewhat consistent pattern, like popular NPR shows like Invisibilia, TAL, Planet Money, Hidden Brain, etc. Other then that, they talk about the issues that I want to know about, especially recent news which is informative but feeds the emotional need. Please don't let these haters on the reviews sway your opinion of this great podcast.

The topics come across as opinionated rants rather than well-researched point of views. I also find it quite disappointing to hear race addressed with such clunky stereotypes in a podcast that is supposedly an intellectual conversation. For me it is borderline comical that the phrase ""persons of color"" is en vogue in public discourse as if ""white"" somehow presupposes some absence of any color. I also think it is lame that the term ""brown"" is being used in this podcast for all non-black minorities. It would never have dawned on me to label Koreans as ""brown"" and to think that minorities don't like the outdoors until this podcast put those ideas in my mind.

The article they continue to reference, ""Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack"" is not current enough to use as a reference in a research paper today, yet it is a cornerstone in this podcast. The authors of this show must think that all white people have yachts and summer homes in wine country, because all of the white privilege indicators seem to line up with the lives of politicians' sons.

Jim Crow laws, housing restrictions and the numerous other exclusionary practices that endured well into the 20th century are areas that deserve journalistic exploration.

All of us white kids did not even think we had a culture!! Seriously white people spend a lot of time pretending not to notice race, and pretending not have biases but we all have them!

"4280","Best background information on coal",2018-05-18,"Doktor Z","I subscribed to Embedded and caught the series on the Trump administration. It was done in that breezy, informational way NPR reports on subjects, a great way to learn in my opinion. I looked forward to the series on coal. I've lived in West Virginia all my life. From 1949 to 1976, I lived in north central West Virginia, in Clarksburg while growing up and in Morgantown while going to school. There was quite a bit of coal mined in these areas until about 1993 when the Clean Air Act passed. Most of the coal in north central WV is of the high sulphur variety, high BTU but very bad to burn because of the sulphur. In 1977 I moved to southern WV. The southern WV coal belt is mostly south of US RT. 60 and west of I-77 (the WV Turnpike). Coal down here is low sulphur. A lot of it is metalurgical coal but also a lot of steam (power generation) coal. Unlike north central WV, the economy, except for Charleston and Huntington (the two largest cities in the state) is not diversified. Coal is king, with politicians but also with the people. It was a job that without any education other than the 80 miners' certification course, you could possibly earn over $100,000/year. Your series hit the nail on the head. Lots of people want coal to ""come back."" They don't realize that it won't. Not only will clean air and waste disposal requirements hinder this but the good coal is gone. Quite often a coal company will have to cut through 30"" of rock (usually sandstone) to get at 16"" of coal. No matter how hard miners work, you can't make money this way. The vast majority of people, including quite a few with some education, would never read a business publication, such as Forthune, Forbes, Business Week, or the Wall Street Journal. If they did, they would learn who is buying the coal or not buying it. They don't understand how fracking affects coal. A powerplant can burn natural gas, which is cheap because of fracking, for a bit more than one fourth the cost of coal. But people love fracking because it upsets environmentalists (a very dirty word in many people's vocabularies). It's a very sad situation. However, ignoring the facts or wishing them to be otherwise won't help. Keep up the good work on this series. You've done very well so far and I look forward the the remainder.",5,"Embedded"

The show makes it seem like Kushner was managing the 666 building one minute and working on Trump‚Äôs campaign the next. This ‚Äúplot hole‚Äù is wildly distracting.

"4586","This American Life on reality steroids",2017-09-06,"KASPDX","Actually, earlier episodes could be called This Non-American Life. I just discovered this series and listened to every episode in one day. You need to be a bit of a dark-side-of-humanity junky but it's painfully good. I've seen some of the negative reviews and find them both valid and overly harsh. It's not a ""good news"" show and delves into and maybe dwells upon some of our most intractable societal problems. But the reporting is good--painfully so. While it does approach macabre voyeurism, it's necessary to approach that line in order to get an in depth look at unpleasant issues like drug abuse, motorcycle gang wars, challenges of race and policing, suicide, practicing medicine in war zones, etc. I'm glad that there are reporters that do this kind of reporting, but God knows why they subject themselves to it. It makes me worry for their mental health a bit. But, each and every episode has informed and sometimes altered my own perspective. That's what is great about NPR and this is another great example of that.",4,"Embedded"

I wanted, based on the podcast title and description, wanted that raw and gritty embedded non biased storytelling as opposed to the new story based on big headlines... this could be great but right now it is simple mediocre.

Admittedly I thought a couple of the episodes were boring and didn't give me much to walk away with, but a few I walked away from feeling profoundly affected, namely The Hospital which takes place in South Sudan. That one really stuck with me for days. I even went to the website to read the full story and to look at the pictures. Another one of my favorites was The School, which takes place in Wilkinsburg Pa, just minutes from my house. Listening to all the local kids and teachers, and the fact that the reporters were here for one of the worst shootings we've had, was chilling to listen to, but I was also able to gain some inside perspective.

In our culture today, it is this kind of thorough, in-depth investigative journalism that takes second financial fiddle to more click-baity or popular interest articles. Kelly McEvers is not only a superb journalist, but an emotional and articulate one to boot. We need more Kellys in this world to convince people that weighty, grave stories can be interesting and resonate emotionally, too. Life is made up of not-so-pleasant stories -- we need to take the rose-colored glasses off and acknowledge and appreciate both the greatest highs and the lowest lows of people we don't fully know or understand. We need someone to help break us out of our own bubble; the task of journalism is to reflect life back to us as truthfully as humanly possible.

I guess it‚Äôs all about taking the listener ‚Äúthere‚Äù right into a situation. The reporter/presenters seem very sympathetic and expressive. But is it enough to just go somewhere and record what‚Äôs happening? Sometimes it works. The Police, The Immigrant, The School, are all great episodes that gave me some more insight into people and places I have never been. But The Bikers, The Capital, and most of all The Arctic, started to seem like like edgy recording projects as tourism. Why we‚Äôre they there? What did we learn? Early in the Arctic episode we hear - ‚ÄúIn the arctic young people are killing themselves. To find out why, Rebecca Hersher went to Greenland for 3 months in the winter.‚Äù Well, all credit due to Rebecca for spending 3 months up there. But did we find out why this is happening? I certainly wanted to know. It seems like it‚Äôs an important thing to try to understand. I never heard an explanation. I heard Rebecca describing how she felt. The last 5 minutes or so was all about how it was affecting her, how she felt overwhelmed. (cue Molly Worthen‚Äôs op-ed piece in the New York Times - Stop Saying ‚ÄòI Feel Like‚Äô 4.30.2016) She ends with ‚ÄúI do it because it feels really exciting.

"4772","Awe inspiring podcast",2016-06-18,"lissieluxo","This tackle tough topics and does it beautifully. They really do ""dig deep"" on the headlines and bring a new dimension to news stories.

"4773","Discomfort Zone",2016-06-18,"Triall","Topics that are tackled are not easy ones to face but we grow by either experiencing or learning through the experiences of others. Some shows are about something that hits close to home such as suicide (even if I don't live in Greenland) and are relatable to me, after which I don't feel alone in my suffering anymore. Other topics covered such as what it's like to be a hopeful NBA player open my eyes (ears) to a whole other world that I wouldn't otherwise have an opportunity to know about. Each eposiode brings an element of discomfort and that is because learning and growing is rarely easy or pleasant but always worth it. Thanks McEvers & team!",5,"Embedded"

"4787","Embedded",2016-06-27,"Half-fast Mantis","I love Kelly McEvers' work on NPR and am so happy she's now co-hosting ATC. And the idea behind this show is great. But the depth and emotion they want just isn't there. Frankly, I feel more moved when I listen to many a 4-minute NPR features than I do spending 20 minutes in the Sudan with ""Embedded."" I think one reason is, that 4-minute feature has a clear focus, a point they want to get across. The point I hear getting across in these episodes is too diffuse:""Life is hard."" Even though they have lots of time, they never develop one character very fully, preferring breadth to depth. And Kelly's vocal phrasing is heavily put upon here and artificial. After every sentence, we know we are supposed to think, ""Wow, that's really heavy."" It gets old. All in all, maybe doing one episode a week on a different topic like this is too much. It sounds like the crew parachutes in, rather than really embeds itself into a place or subculture. I really hope NPR figures out this podcast thing; they have a lot of talent, but maybe they are looking at this new medium in too superficial a way to conquer it.",3,"Embedded"
"4788","Great episode",2016-06-28,"Rrssthbokvar","I've honestly become pretty obsessed with embedded.

"4792","Terrible",2016-06-14,"Kj440","Liked this podcast until the latest school episode one. Couldn't even get through the whole thing with them spewing their media bs.

"4793","Amazing",2016-06-14,"TaraJeanRay","I'm always looking for podcasts that challenge me to think outside of the world I know and experience daily. Embedded does just that.

"4834","Finally said goodbye",2016-06-06,"skihigh2002","I stuck with the podcast for the first half dozen episodes. I thought maybe they would find stories that didn't wallow in the misery of others. Nope. I'm not saying I want a ""feel good story"" every week but come'on, a little levity wouldn't hurt. Also, the ads are incredibly annoying.

"4835","disappointing",2016-06-06,"Steven Loy","I've never written a review, but with this podcast I feel I must warn against the false claims of the show's mkaers. It is touted as ""going deep"" into a story, but after listening to a few episodes, it clearly does no such thing, nor does it presume to. ""Going deep"" implies research, fact checking, multiple interviews with both sides of the story, background, context, efforts at solutions, etc... what people used to call feature reporting. But this show just presents a ""day-in-the-life"" portrait of the situation. Its just not possible to learn the truth about all sides of a story with one day of on-location interviews and reporting. So enjoy this podcast for what it is - superficial one-day fact gathering and character portraits, delivered in teenager-speak and Sarah-Koenig-like narration. But under no definition do the reproters ""go deep"" into a story. And for an NPR production this is a pretty low standard. I'll be sticking with Pro-Publica for stories that ""go deep"".",2,"Embedded"

I've easily listened to 50 different podcasts and multiple episodes of each. Embedded is in my top three. Each week they choose a subject that you might not expect to be interested in but they present it such a way that makes you wonder why you haven't bern curious about it before. Kelly McEvers, the host, has a pleasant voice and helps bring the stories to life. If you listen to many podcasts, you will appreciate the producer who makes sure that all voice levels are equal. You don't have to turn up the volume for one person and down for another. I look forward every week to a new episode. Thank you!!",5,"Embedded"

Sometimes I feel like it's a little bit too short. They end it and I feel like they could have gone a little bit farther with it but I think they are just trying to get these issues on people's minds to start a discussion. One of my friends and I listen to this and then come together and discuss the issue that week, and while we may not always agree on the issue Kelly presents it always leads to a great conversation and debate on the topic.

This show is maybe one of the most insightful and enlightening podcasts you'll listen to.

"5080","The Immigrant",2016-05-02,"Thenewalchemist","I cannot even begin to express how insanely frustrated I am with the state of our government and social society. This episode is a perfect example of how wrong-headed we have become. At least how wrong ‚Äúthe powers that be‚Äù have been and are. To deport this man to a country he has little if any ties to is totally insane. The result is NOT helping anyone. The result is emotional pain and brokeness on both sides. A destroyed man and emotionally devastated family. It makes me sick, it makes me want to cry, it makes me enraged. And all for what? Because a young confused and lost immigrant smoked a little weed to ease the pain of life? This is the opposite of empathy and compassion, this is hate. The ‚Äúpowers that be‚Äù (that being the judges, prosecutors and corporate entity of CCA) are exercising hate at will for profit. We should all be embarrassed, disgusted and enraged. This is an excellent example of how broken and wrong we have become. Thank you Kelly for your intellect and courage to expose this to the world.",5,"Embedded"

"5092","Disappointing",2016-04-29,"Metaphorically Inky","The title led me astray: ‚ÄúEmbedded‚Äù implies insight gained through longer-term involvement in an area or a group. This podcast has some good reporting, and no doubt spending 3-4 days in El Salvador in that particular situation was emotionally impactful for the reporters. But it is not being embedded, nor does the El Salvador or the other episodes offer much more than anyone else‚Äôs reportage. It‚Äôs well-done, but falls far short of what I‚Äôd expect from an Embed. It remains superficial, sadly; the same group, spending more time, would give us much more. Would you trust the judgement of someone who went somewhere, traveled around a few days with a fixer, asked the fixer some questions, and then purported to really know the country or subject? A nice start, but the first thing I‚Äôd fix about this podcast is a title which raises expectations that are not met.",3,"Embedded"
"5093","Good investigation and reporting. Only needs a finishing line.",2016-04-29,"iPaloAltan","I liked it because he episodes are based on real life stories, well investigated and smoothly reported.

"5126","I am addicted to these podcasts!",2016-04-29,"Leviconstant","Amazing stories that really captivate the audience and pulls them right into whats happening. Once I begin an episode I can't turn it off. Kelly is incredibly insightful and poses unique and very thought provoking questions that really require some thought. Her voice is so nice to listen too and I seriously wish all my books on tape could come in her voice! I love her sense of curiosity and the fact that she and her team dive right into all situations-whether it's with gangs in El Salvador, bikers in Texas,or drug users in rural America-she's there getting the real scoop of the story. We seriously need more reporting like this. This is what reporting is and should be about-getting the real story and going to places where the average joe doesn't want to go or reporting on stories and issues that mainstream media wants nothing to do with and tries to cover up. Please keep up with these podcasts! The American public needs you to get the truth out there-no matter what the topic is. Maybe you could do some reporting on touchy political issues/scandals? Or into the drug corporations and their ridiculous amount of pull in the government and outside of it-basically they control america now. Or maybe the food industry and how nutrition deficient and bad for us most of the food out there is? Our country needs to change and I think this podcast has the potential to be a huge catalyst for national change-I mean just look at the effect this had on the whole case with the high school kid who was wrongfully accused of murder! No one would've given his case a second thought if it wasn't for Kelly's reporting!!!",5,"Embedded"

I had been searching for a new entertaining and enlightening podcast when I checked the charts and found this one - that was 24 hours ago - and I have now listened to all 6 currently available. The storytelling is so important but even moreso the narrator must buy good. Have a certain umami that's almost indescribable and that element exists because of Kelly as she draws you in and makes you feel like you are right there with her. I am all caught up so for now, as with my other favs like this American life, Radiolab, and Reply All, I have to wait until the next episode.

In Embedded, she takes it to a whole new level - and in the process she is performing a valuable service. So much of our news consumption is bite size. We see a headline and a brief summary, and then - nothing. Perhaps a follow-up that's relegated to the digital equivalent of the newspaper, page C27, buried out of sight.

"5241","Wanted to like it but it is terrible",2016-04-21,"Pseudobrainy","For a show that is intended to go deep there is a decided lack of depth to the stories. There is merely exploitation of trite generalizations and sensationalism. Where‚Äôs the background? the research? the political and historical perspective? Just jump into a situation, spend three days, do a poor job of editing and stream it. I listened through to today and the skid road episode but won‚Äôt be listening anymore. The tone of this episode was truly awful, I did not find any content here that added any value to these tremendous problems in any meaningful way. Oh wait I see, I just went to the NPR website and see that this episode is a rework of content delivered on the radio a year ago. Well all the worse then.

"5358","Disappointed --Definitely Not the Quality of Serial",2016-04-15,"Birdgrrl","I love in-depth reporting and was looking forward to this podcast. However, I find it voyeuristic and somewhat shallow. The reporter almost seems like a naive suburbanite who thrills at exposure to ""the dark side."" What I found missing is sensitivity to the interviewees and possibly a lack of enough life experience to thoughtfully mine sensitive subjects. The reporter's cheery style and awkward questions made for too many cringe-worthy moments. The podcast also fails to put stories into their larger context. There are a lot of political issues impacting the Indiana addicts story related to education, the governor that could have made it more interesting and help people understand the complexities of how this addiction/HIV crisis happened in bucolic Austin, Indiana. The next story on the biker fight in Texas struck me the same. ""Ohh--bikers are kinda cool and scary!! What's their story? Look at us, we get to talk to cool, scary bikers!"" --is the tone of the story without a whole lot of other less than obvious insights.

In a day and age where the public's collective attention span is comparable to that of a gnat, Embedded returns us to the days of honest-to-goodness investigative journalism. Instead of a 2-minute story, we are taken deeper into the story. We feel the tension and even fear that the reporters feel. Much of that immersion is due to the outstanding sound and music editing. We, the listeners, become embedded.",5,"Embedded"

Now, listening to Embedded, I'm back to holding my breath. Throughout each episode, I feel like I'm right there with her - her narrative creates such vivid imagery.

I love NPR and this is so far beneath them I can‚Äôt even imagine who gave this the go-ahead. There is a good way to do really thought provoking, introspective pieces that center around a reporter being part of the story. And there‚Äôs a cheap, desperate way to do it. Unfortunately this is the latter. The reporter sounded excited to be watching people shoot up drugs, she provided step by step how-to instructions on how to cook pain killers including ways to remove the outer pill covering and filter out the additives, and she was completely ham handed in all her interactions with the people she was interviewing (people who were generally impaired by drugs, which I guess makes it easy to get their consent and makes for better radio) and barely touched on any of the background of the epidemic, the fact that these people were the epicenter of the recent HIV epidemic or anything other than ‚Äúwhat does it feel like to be high?‚Äù and ‚Äúso I hear you lost your children, what‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù I was so repulsed by the reporter by the end. Completely the wrong person for the job and the podcast was just filled with so many cheap ‚Äòshock‚Äô set up shots. It was more like watching Geraldo Rivera trying to spark a fight on stage while sticking microphones in people‚Äôs faces. So outside NPR‚Äôs usual quality of design, writing, reporting or execution of ideas.",1,"Embedded"

Once I realized it was real, I figured I'd give it a try since I enjoy most NPR shows. I could barely make it through the first episode. The podcast name makes it sound like the point of the show is for the reporter to get deep into a story, making meaningful connections with the subjects and gaining new insight. Instead the first episode sounded like every other superficial story I've read/hear on opiate addiction. I'm not surprised that interviewees gave ""one word responses""; they seemed like they just didn't want to answer the dumb questions of a reporter who seems to have zero experience with the realities of drug addiction and no real concern for the people in the story. I might try another episode later, but I'm not sure why, since NPR is pushing this show so hard, they decided to lead with such a bland, pointless first episode. Shallow reporting narrated by Captain Obvious.",1,"Embedded"

"5530","TIME FOR CHANGE",2016-04-04,"RxKittycatloverRx","It's time to start changing public opinion in regards to addiction. The media does a great job of showing us the worst of my kind. They show the worst case senecio of what drug addiction looks like. %1 of the substance enthusiast population is portrayed as will lacking, poor and uneducated. with any group of people there will always be those that take it to the extreme. For example Isis. That is probably less than %1 of people of the Muslim faith. We must resist the temptation to apply what we see on the news and apply it to all Muslims. Public perception has little remorse for addicts. They are ostracized from society and viewed as people that just need to summon the will to stop, pick themselves up by there bootstraps and surrender to a higher power. This story helps change that perception by showing non-users the complexities of physical opioid dependence. This was written by somebody that has a job, a family, a dream, and a life threatening disease that isn't curable but is treatable. Lets start treating addiction by changing perception towards my kind. We can't eliminate all drugs just like we can't stop people from humping, but we can invest in publicly funded programs that make it safe to do either one of those things. I dose intravenously (slam, shot-up, IV, bang, ride the Crimson cruise) 5-10 times a day, everyday, for 4 years and counting. That's a lot of needles! let's make it easy to get clean ones and properly dispose of used ones so that I can continue to have proudly never shared a needle. If it gets any harder and republicans (not exclusively) fight needle exchange services the way they fight planed parenthood centers I will join the community of my peers that have crossed that threshold. knowing I had exhausted every possibly resource within my means before resorting to doing the unthinkable. Addicts are people too, some of the %99 that aren't newsworthy may even be good, honest, kind, educated, empathetic, decent hardworking Americans that are treating themselves the only way they know how. Addiction itself is like a prison, what's the point of actually putting us in prison? Why waste taxpayer dollars on that. Let us use that money to make it safe and less judgmental to treat our affliction. It's scary and nerve wracking and full of judgmental eyes going in and out of a needle exchange. You wonder why people in ep.1 share in the first place. Why do employers drug test? That's like cancer checking an employee. It's a disease, we can't help it, please don't discriminate. I bet people with cancer would be in the news all the time for theft if we didn't let them have jobs either......",5,"Embedded"

I get the advertisement of the day, then a squeaky ""fast forwarding"" noise, and then the rest of the podcast is silence. If I listen to the same podcast through Stitcher, it is okay.

It occasionaly checks for a new file, downloads it, and then plays it at the end of your next song. After it is over, it picks up whereever you left off in your playlist. This makes it very much like the hourly news summary you get on an NPR station and used to get on most commerical stations too.

I‚Äôm a libertarian, and clearly this podcast has a left-leaning anti-Trump bias. Not a Trump fan, but personally, I‚Äôd rather hear the news and make up my own mind. Rachel Martin has a great voice but inexplicably delivers her lines in a sing-song voice, as if the message itself was not entertaining enough.

Update: I just wanted to thank NPR for reminding me how incredibly biased they are. Normally I try to remember that I need to take everything they say with a grain of salt, but I also expect some journalistic honesty from them. Well, coverage of the Covington High School Debacle, which I happened to have followed more closely than most news stories, reminded me of how aggressively all reporting here is filtered though a specific narrative.

"5972","Trump mouthpiece",2019-02-17,"The Real Zen Boy","The political coverage is extremely unprofessional. After every other news agency realized the mistake they made by being Trump‚Äôs publicists, NPR has decided to double down. There was one episode where the Trump Administration did something completely incomprehensible and offered no reason, the host asks the reporter what explanation/reasoning was being offered, and after saying they offered nothing proceeded to offer her own explanation of what she thought they might say. It was the absolute low point in NPR news coverage. Every single episode starts off with whatever inconsequential thing Trump is doing. It‚Äôs absolutely childish and pathetic. Meanwhile there are major news events going on that they completely ignore. Hurricane destroying your state? Too bad, we are going to lead with Trump goes to a campaign rally, and might mention you at the end. This podcast couldn‚Äôt be worse even if it was written by Trump‚Äôs press office, which considering the laziness of the reporters to actually go out and report the news, most likely is the case. Additionally, they go to great lengths to defend the indefensible, while ignoring the litany of felonies being committed by politicians. Instead of feeling more informed and educated, all you do is shake your head at lack of any journalistic standards whatsoever and feel like you completely wasted your time. There are much better news sources out there. This one is worse than Fox.

I‚Äôve subscribed to Up First for around two or three months at this point, and, after giving it the opportunity to grown on me, I‚Äôve found that it is not hitting my expectations. The hosts undoubtedly let their various biases shine through, which is troubling no matter where you fall on political, social, and cultural spectra. Also, I feel as if the show could benefit from bringing new ideas to the reporting table like The Daily has. These points aside, it‚Äôs just also not very engaging and gripping. A 1-star rating would be unfair because their work to gather and report things by 6am ET should be appreciated, but I ultimately feel like more value can be found elsewhere in the podcasting world.",2,"UpFirst"

The Molly Tibbetts murder was never even brought up by one of the four main hosts, it took one of the political NPR reporters they regularly bring on for insight. The part the main hosts did talk about was of course border patrol and how Trump wants to control it. But if there‚Äôs a scandal in the Catholic Church it won‚Äôt be missed on their lineup. Anything to do with Trump, against Trump, scandals... can‚Äôt it be all news headlines, not just one side of it or what this crew deems as newsworthy?

Furthermore, not 5 minutes later, their coverage of the FISA authorized wiretapping of Carter Page, neglected to reference the recorded interview where Page, in his own words, said he had acted on behalf of Russian government officials in 2013.

No they weren't. Everyone living in the Israeli borders at the time Israel became a nation was welcome to stay as an Israeli citizen. Many did. Many didn't. Once again Israel is painted at the bad guys. Not to mention the poor Trump coverage. We never hear anything about what our president is actually doing.

"6858","Poor commentary and too general",2017-10-03,"Anj1618","The length of the podcast is definitely limiting. Other daily news podcasts like BBC Global News Podcast are much more in depth and cover all sides of a headline. The duration of the podcast is surely convenient, but it's shallow and lacks variety and focus. Also some insensitive commentary. For example, when describing the post-hurricane situation in Puerto Rico, they referred to the people in the streets as doing ""urban-camping."" These people have nothing and have no choice but to live in shelters and on the streets. Portraying this desperation as ""camping"" neglects the harsh reality of the situation. Headlines are usually America-centered and it takes a few days for them to report the goings-on of other countries like the racial-cleansing in Myanmar and the Catalan referendum in Spain. Overall, would not recommend for anyone who wants more than a shallow view of American news.",2,"UpFirst"

Given the short timeframe, of course I am not asking for a research or anything, but it is not hard to just include more than one voice, probably takes 1 minute I guess. As for the comment ""red is a communist color,"" it is just completely unnecessary to add that.

It took them a few weeks to figure out the content and tone (the attempts at ""relevant"" pop culture content as a third of the program early missed the mark a bit), but I think by now they've really hit their stride, and it's a thoroughly enjoyable and informative podcast.

It gives you the facts you need to keep up with all the major news in one short, convenient daily package, and you can feel confident that it's coming from a reliable source.

Someone in my class brought up her album Lemonade the next week and I completely understood the reference - whereas before I would have missed what they were talking about.

It is much louder than the voice volume. It is so loud it distracts from the commentary at the beginning, and makes the hosts hard to hear.

If you want sound bite updates go to the NPR One app (love it!) and listen to the hourly updates. I'd happily change this rating if the podcast actually started doing a bit of in depth reporting - choose one topic to cover in the morning, not five. Anyways, hope this is constructive.

"8081","Overall good, sometimes problematic",2018-08-20,"deliciousbrie","I generally enjoy Terry‚Äôs interviews but I found her interview of the author of crazy rich Asians to be problematic. From her questions, I thought she lacked understanding of the subject matter (Asians of all nationalities and the struggle for representation). I‚Äôve listened to tons of Terry‚Äôs interviews, usually good, but this one stood out because she seemed to have done no research prior to the interview. She was overly fixated on the topic of wealth and her approach to the discussion of Asian and Asian American struggles were superficial. Example: terry‚Äôs discussion of the plastic surgery phenomenon is presented as purely an Asian desire to look ‚Äúwestern‚Äù. The truth of the matter is, there are billions of Asians in the world and many of them do not look ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù based on western stereotypes. Walk around China and you will see Chinese people who do not look ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù as westerners expect, because the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù people isn‚Äôt a mono-ethnic group and there is a long history of various peoples getting assimilated into the Chinese population. Furthermore, do I even need to bring up the reality that many caucasians are using plastic surgery to look more ‚Äúexotic‚Äù or ‚Äúmultiracial‚Äù. The fake tans, the breast implants, butt implants, lip injections ‚Äî these augmented features are hardly the stereotypic physical features of caucasians. What I find problematic is that when Asians get plastic surgery, it‚Äôs presented as ‚ÄúAsians wanting to look western‚Äù but when caucasians get plastic surgery, it‚Äôs presented as ‚Äújust wanting to look more attractive‚Äù. This is quite a limited POV. Lastly, the topic of ‚Äúracial purity‚Äù (is the actor who played the male protagonist ‚ÄúAsian enough‚Äù) is exceptionally problematic. There is only one race, the human race. Go back enough generations and all of us are of ‚Äúmixed ancestries‚Äù. How many generations back do we have to trace to be considered ‚Äúracially pure‚Äù enough? President Obama is half Caucasian, but everybody refers to him as the ‚Äúfirst black president‚Äù. The trap that biracial or multiracial people find themselves falling into is that they‚Äôre always forced into one category or the other by society. In the case of multiracial Asian actors, they‚Äôre always labeled as too Asian to play white characters but also too white to play Asian characters. This is a very sad state of things.",2,"FreshAir"

Terry Gross is a highly skilled interviewer who is easy to listen to and appears to put her guests at ease. I don‚Äôt understand why she tries to occasionally cover religious topics when she only invites atheists and never people of faith. If she is not comfortable with Christianity, it would make sense to not cover religion at all rather than present this perspective that is so out of the mainstream and unbalanced. I am not sure what the point is in those episodes but fortunately they are somewhat rare. Otherwise a great podcast and often highly educational.",4,"FreshAir"

Even when she has brilliant and fascinating people on who are more than capable of articulating a nuanced idea or opinion, the questions and conversations are decidedly low-brow. I understand this is a podcast for the masses, but I think we could handle a little bit more... the pop culture reviewers, however, are excellent, not because I agree with their opinions, but rather because of the quality of their wit and the depth and sensitivity of their aesthetic perspectives.",2,"FreshAir"

Seems dominated by arts content now, so not as much interesting variation. One of the few segments I've heard lately on a non-arts topic was a big turnoff: in ""The Education of Mitch McConnell"" segment, Terry threw up exclusively softball questions that didn't challenge any of the guest's positions in the slightest. Pretty disappointing from the host who at one time was known for being easygoing but u afraid to challenge everyone from Bill O'Riley to Hillary Clinton. Too much good stuff available these days that actually probes the complexities of the issues... Sad to say I'm done with Fresh Air",2,"FreshAir"

They're very interesting, in-depth interviews with experts on various topics or personalities in the entertainment industry. I find the quietness a bit annoying--other podcasts I subscribe to can be heard perfectly if played on full blast on my iPad; this one is just *too quiet.* I like listening to podcasts while doing the dishes or baking, and other podcasts can be heard over the din when played at full level; this one can't. I know that they deliberely speak in that ""soothing,"" hushed NPR tone, but I wish they would enhance the volume of this podcast so it can be clearly heard when played at full volume on an iPad. It's fine if I download it to my iPod instead and listen to it with headphones, but I prefer to just set my iPad down and play it from there, because I don't want to shut the whole world out (and have someone come home and startle me) and because the Podcasts app works fine within an iPad but crashes frequently on an iPod. I wish Terry would speak up rather than practically whisper, because her guests inevitably end up mirroring this barely-audible tone.

The new practice of splitting up the broadcast into smaller podcast episodes is a failure. It foils the automatic update and splinters the continuity of the show. And the editing?? They managed to leave in the car commercial (oops, sorry NPR - sponsorship), but cut out the Ornette Coleman outro? One plus - it makes the countless repeat episodes ('now out in paperback . . .') easier to skip without having to skip over Ed Ward as well.",2,"FreshAir"
"8603","Fragmented Episodes :-(",2012-04-09,"DayWhirl","I like the new titles, but not how the podcasts are fragmented into sections.

It plays in our area when I am picking up my 5 year old from preschool. I often would find a day so packed with block stacking, and baths and painting that I would miss the day's podcast entirely. I loved that you would allow us to go back and listen to shows further back than just the previous show. No worries, I could always catch the podcast.Until now. When I visited your iTunes site I found only a 6 minute excerpt. I don't know that i will waste my time downloading a portion of the show (especially if those portions consist of monologues).

You know this show, while sometimes the subject could sound a little less than exciting, I find that Terry and her crew research and ask thought provoking questions that not only make the subject matter fascinating, but also I usually walk away a little more enlighten. I'm very thankful that I don't snub the shows based on the title and I give each show a chance. Life is sometimes a grab bag, so relax, give it a try... you might just learn something new.

I listened for a few minutes until they played his music, then I HAD to turn off the garbage. I am completely not interested in rap music, but I am also not interested in many other people Terry interviews and I end up hooked. I think rap artists and NPR listeners do not mesh well. The NPR demographics do not support rap or the rap lifestyle, so the fact that Jay-Z was interviewed at all confuses me. Other than that horrible interview, the rest of the shows are great.

What I find most often is a show from a very specific political viewpoint that is decidedly favorable toward what is happening in Washington today. What I would like to see is something more insightful and balanced. Why not analyze what is disguised as healthcare reform and how the Constitution is impacted by it. Why isn't anything being said about the government's quick assumption of control over more than 50% of the economy in the period of a year? Why isn't there discussion of the open disdain and even contempt of any view that differs from what is now becoming the unholy trinity of the executive and legislative branches? Why isn't there discussion of how the current occupant of the White House is using the House and Senate as his personal lackies? Chicago politics have moved just a short geographical distance, but have taken a huge political jump. We are not the free country we were just a year ago, and no one is calling anyone on it.

"8773","review for 12-11-09 podcast",2009-12-14,"JKF_alone","Normally I enjoy Fresh Air, even when I disagree with the point of view. In this episode, we have a reading from an exceedingly graphic rape novel, discussion of Hitler's favorite singer, and Thomas Hoving talking about his time at the Met. The first segment is stomach wrenching for anyone with an ounce of compassion, the middle dull, and the last segment (Mr. Hoving's) is infuriating. If he was a politician or CEO, his actions would have been cause for imprisonment. He is proud that he devalued a painting he purchased by starting a dis- information campaign. in politics it would be called slander, in business it would be an unethical practice, but as an Art Director, it's clever and something to advertise. He is also proud of selling items of real value, and purchasing items of questionable, transient value. In the host's famous interview with Gene Simmons from Kiss, he is taken to taken to task for his behavior, and persona. Mr. Hoving, on the other hand, is allowed to crow on his soapbox about how wonderful he is, and use public radio to attack his enemies. A few suggestions;",1,"FreshAir"

Gross can't hold a candle to other NPR moderator/hosts like Tom Ashbrook or Diane Rehm. She almost always champions the view I hold, but unlike most people writing reviews here apparently, I'm not going to act like somebody's the world's greatest just because I agree with her. That's sort of different from being good--or responsible--at her job. (Ironically, that's the same reason why people will rate this review as ""not helpful"": not because it isn't helpful--seriously, what is or isn't helpful about a 200-word comment on a podcast?--but because it doesn't mesh with their prejudices.)",1,"FreshAir"

He's not even religious! Oh, because it's common sense, common decency which the far right has proven to be lacking. Anyway, the podcast does need some work in terms of editing.

The reason they can't include the songs in some podcasts is because people would be able to edit the podcast to take out the interviews and get the music for free. This creates licensing problems.

Over the last few months the quality of the podcast has gone downhill (makes me wonder if there have been some cuts at NPR?). Gone is the pleasant NPR outro jingle. Now we have choppy editing and shows often cut off mid-run. Songs are edited out. Today's podcast, an interview with Uma Thurman, cuts off at the 1:17 mark (I've downloaded it 3 times so it's not me...).

For my tastes, Mrs. Gross is a little one-sided and somtimes seems a little unsure of her self (uncomfortable laughter). Please don't misunderstand. I appreciate and admire her abilities to front such a long-lasting, interesting show. Another point, I also don't like the current book reviewer.

I have often learned of books, CDs, movies or TV shows that I never would have watched if I had not listened to this show. In addition to Terry's skills as an interviewer, the show brings in some of the best movie and music critics to round out the last 10-15 minutes of each show. I rarely miss an episode.",5,"FreshAir"

She's learned, and as I once heard her described ""could interview a slug and make it interesting"". After G.W. Bush took office she went, as NPR in general and shows such as Frontline on PBS did, on a liberal crusade. If you're a liberal it will be reassuring listening, but for Libertarians and middle of the roaders you will find many of the last 6 years of interviews to be quite biased whenever the guest is of a political bent. It's tiring, and doesn't suit her style. She's at her best when interviewing musicians, actors, writers, etc. Perhaps if a democrat is elected in 2008 she and NPR will relax and get back to what they do best. I hope so.

This NPR interview is the first time I've ever heard him out of character, and he's wonderful. He even stayed in character in front of President Bush (and roasted him good), and I think possibly NPR is the only place where he could drop the persona an simply be himself.

"8886","Fresh Air",2007-04-22,"Libertarian","I am sickened that so many people think Terry Gross is great. She is an accomplished interiewer and has a very good concept underlying her show; however, Terry Gross is a hopeless liberal who is totally unable to mask her political affiliation and who, like too many of her colleagues shows her political leanings through the content she chooses for her programs. Terry should stick to interviewing people from the arts and entertainment where most people expect that liberal and illogical views will be espoused; venturing into the political or social field is dangerous territory where Terry will wade fearlessly into the liberal mire where she should not be allowed to enter without a counterweight. That said I still listen to the show as despite its severe shortcomings NPR, of which Fresh Air is a prominent part, is simply the best radio available when the BBC is not airing.",4,"FreshAir"

Her interviews are generous and composed of questions that are not being asked by every other interviewer in the oft times flavorless stew that comprises American contemporary media. As a test, check out her interview with Danny Devito -- it's not schmaltzy confessions, it's as thorough an examination of Devito's inspirations and history as one can experience. Ms. Gross' personal and journalistic curiosity is unmistakable. She is in a league with few peers; her show is fabulous.

I have been a faithful listener for the past year or so and have learned so much as a result of your wonderful storytelling. As an East Asian American, I know it is incumbent upon me to listen and learn from other communities of color, who have been disproportionately marginalized in this country. For me, listening to Latino USA is not just about information-gathering, though there is much to gather, or finding a temporary respite from the often monotonous legal world I work in; it is about identifying with our collective humanity and as a byproduct, being blessed - every time I listen - by the beauty, resilience, and hope the Latinx community exudes.",5,"LatinoUSA"

Episodes like the one about abuelas, the one about bodegas, and the one about the death of Jos√© de Jes√∫s are among my absolute favorite podcast episodes of all time. So I always recommend the show without hesitation. But I'm not liking the new 2018 format so much. Having only one story per episode rather than multiple pieces on a given theme makes me feel like I'm missing out on shorter yet important and interesting stories (like the one about TPS). I listen from Colombia, so there's no practical way for me to listen to the full show on public radio. So it would be nice if they either offered the full show as a podcast (rather than burying it in the website) as an alternative to the standalone pieces, or if they made good on their promise to put out many stories per week.

I like the episodes that talk about obscure Latino history, culture, or little known important Latino leaders. I do not like the episodes that repeat popular discourse or opinion. Please feature more novel topics! We US Latinos are interested in way more than just immigration, soccer, injustice, and Spanglish. Talk about our countries of origin, our rich cultural and political history, and modern everyday Latino leaders and heroes (beyond the usual Sotomayor, Castro brothers, and Lin-Manuel Miranda).

"9282","Finally touching base with my roots",2016-07-26,"Second Chance?","On my father's side, my Abuelo and Abuela were Spanish speaking immigrants to the States - from Costa Rica and Puerto Rico respectively. Sadly, Abuelo died before I was born and Abuela died when I was 4, so I never knew them. And, my father never spoke Spanish or about his upbringing. So, I never really had exposure to the Latino culture nor thought of myself as Latino. But this podcast has helped me to start to connect with and understand those who I am connected to through the Abuelo and Abuela I never knew. It has also helped me to understand more about the struggles of those who are Spanish-speaking and/or non-whites in the States. Thank you for helping me to widen my view of the country I grew up in and those that make it more diverse and special.",5,"LatinoUSA"

As a gay, undocumented immigrant with a disability living in the U.S., rarely do I get to hear stories that remotely get close to the same journey or experience that I have had while living in this part of the world--far away from home. The stories shared in this podcast asre so genuinely diverse and beautifully unique. It's great to know that the Latino USA staff recognizes the broadness of what it means to be Latino; queer, mixed race, and to even acknowledge gender and our broad political perspectives as Latinos. Hearing about the Dreamers have made me cry, learning about queer Latinos in the Stonewall raids has made me proud, and hearing all the different Spanish accents has made me smile. If they start incorporating more stories of atheist and secular Latinos, I'll smile even brighter! Gracias Latino USA. We are listening.",5,"LatinoUSA"

The podcasts have their own rhythmic quality‚Äîthey‚Äôre just really really nice to listen to with the mix of voices, stories, and amaaaazing music. The podcasts feels homey and warm, they remind me of home, and I always learn something new or about somebody new and feel inspired to keep pushing for social change. The stories are varied, unique, interesting, and important. The first episode I heard was the Afro-Latino episode, and the stories there were an opening into a huge world of experiences, stories, and people that I can relate to as a Black American. I‚Äôve listened to so many episodes since, and I absolutely love Latino USA! Thank you all for your work to give space to the voices of Latino people and your stories.

However, I have never fallen asleep. I learn so much from each podcast. No matter what the theme or topic that Maria Hinojosa covers in any one particular podcast, I always feel like there are incredible heroes and sheroes all across America who are making our world a better place. What is really inspiring about Latino USA is that it is about people who sound just like some of the people in my own family.

My family moved to the US to live the so called ""American Dream"" when I was 6 months old. To be completely honest we never saw that dream come fruition. It took my father taking a job here in Kuwait and then me following him to be able to live that dream. Here after a couple of years of working and saving money I opened the first Puerto Rican restaurant in the Middle East. It has not been easy but definitely easier and better than when we lived in the US. Atleast in Kuwait being Latino is not considered a bad thing.",5,"LatinoUSA"

I received my BA in Latin American/Latino Studies from UIC in 2009 and have been craving access to the issues I was once so passionate about. Latino USA has really helped me stay up to date on issues involving not just Latinos, but all people of color. Its segments are well thought out and extremely entertaining. As a high school history teacher now, it was provided me with not just an alternative news source, but also strong narratives that I am able to bring to the classroom.

"9468","Trans-inclusive Programming",2015-09-19,"readj","Latino USA is my favorite podcast for two reasons. The first is that I haven‚Äôt heard any other show that covers so much cultural diversity.

The second reason Latino USA is my favorite podcast is that no other show does a better job of covering trans and queer issues in a real way. I am a young, white, queer transman and even shows like ‚ÄúAll Things Considered‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath, Sex, and Money‚Äù make me feel like an outsider in the way they cover issues relevant to my life.

So for me, and many others, this podcast is a godsend. It's not a political podcast, an entertainment podcast, a historical podcast, or really any genre-specific podcast: it's Latino USA. It covers anything and everything that happens within the Latino community, and they've been doing it for years! As the Latino community grows larger in the coming decades, more media organizations are going to try to jump on the bandwagon and produce similar content (which is good), but Latino USA will ALWAYS be my go-to, #1 source for an accurate and compelling weekly look into the my national Latino community and everything that makes it what it is.

Therefore, it is great to have a program like this that discusses issues that affect our community. Not only does Latino USA give you alternative views into Latino issues but it also discusses art, culture, religion and various other topics. They also give other minorities a voice. They discuss affirmative action not just from black vs white perspective that has always been the focus of traditional American media but from the perspective of Asian Americans. They did a whole section on Japanese internment camps and large Asian populations in Latin American countries. They discuss colorism in Latin American countries and what it's like to be an Afro-Latina woman both in Latin America (specifically Cuba and the Dominican Republic) as well as in the United States (where the only Latinas who get any are validated and get exposure are fair skinned Latinas ala Sofia Vergara (and even she had to darken her naturally blonde hair to be seen as a viable Latina woman.",5,"LatinoUSA"
