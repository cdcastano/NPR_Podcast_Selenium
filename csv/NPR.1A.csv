Worthy Replacement for daily Diane Rehm Show,04/30/2019,R43T,"Although no one can replace Diane Rehm, Joshua Johnson is going a great job hosting 1A. I like the wide range of topics and the even-handed, let's get to the essential truth approach Joshua uses with all the topics and guests.",5
Well Presented and inclusive,04/23/2019,chocchipman,Joshua Johnson and the team producing this podcast do a fantastic job of raising and exploring profound questions important to our local and notional conversations. Thank you.,5
Exceptionally Biased — Unsubscribe,04/15/2019,Deleted this game,"I could not listen to this one sided,clearly partisan discussion.",1
"Insane, far right wing apologist",04/12/2019,Zizifex,"If it makes for good, balanced reporting to have off the deep end far right pundits like Inez Stepman on, there should also be far left pundits to counter Stepman. However, there never are. 1a, like most media, has been gamed by secretive libertarians that claim everything is biased left and so give a platform to joyless misanthropes like Inez Stepman. Sadly, Joshua Johnson gives oxygen to sometimes appalling white privilege fear based points of view. So disappointing on so many levels, far too often.",1
Not on point,04/09/2019,YaxieBherga,"Sorry to say that I stopped listening and change the station... when it is on my local npr station. The thing that tipped my scale was when he was interviewing a young African American girl. The topic was that she and other girls of color were being treated differently in relation to the dress code. The host’s response was patronizing. Instead of following the point, he asked her if she can understand the perspective of a father trying to protect his daughter from (xyz-fill in the sexist and limiting fear story,) which had nothing to do with what the girl was describing. She was too young to redirect him and no one else did either. He basically joined the adults who were bullying her body into repression.",2
More balance,04/03/2019,Markewms,"Diane would never have handed off to a conservative, but she handed off to a really sharp, quick, erudite successor. I just wish for a bit more balance sometimes. Nothing wrong with an occasional clash of ideas.",3
terrible,03/26/2019,Khkhgkhg,he gets all weird if he's jealous of someone he interviews....,1
How to raise Boys,03/25/2019,Dennesau,Candis Pin is erroneous in saying that male and female brains are different that theory has been debunked and to her veteran status is paired with her antiquated thoughts and beliefs in old research. As of late the research sez that truly from infancy males and females are treated differently therefore by the time they reach school age they will already fall into gender roles. It has been concluded that baby girls are spoken to more than baby boys and that baby boys are played with hands more than baby girls thus the upbringing of children is what separates them falls on parents to treat either the same and not as a sex.,5
Free and Responsible Speech is Alive and We’ll,03/21/2019,H31974,"1A offers the best news round table on the air. The first hour is dedicated to domestic news and the second hour is dedicated to international news. The host is smart, respectful, curious, and prone to making nerdy pop culture references.",5
Top Notch with insightful guests about current events,03/20/2019,greensmile098,Love this podcast! This is my main source of keeping up with current events. Host is fair and open to many points of view while monitoring guests.,5
Enough already,12/23/2018,Hate A1 sauce,"This isn't an NPR-worthy program. NPR isn't talk radio. It's supposed to be educational, informative and thought-provoking. I expect intelligent programming from NPR, not a drive-time radio call-in show. Replace it already. Please.",1
What you need to know in an intelligent & fun production,12/24/2018,LANCEMAN 9,Open your ears & your mind. Let Joshua Johnson & the 1A staff will take you on a journey with this great everyday podcast.,5
Far Right Normalization,12/27/2018,Lotus Effects,"A truly sad display of right wing propaganda normalization, dressed up as neutral & fair reporting. It’s unlistenable if you know what’s actually happening to America.",1
Not Diane?,01/01/2019,rbr34,"Comparisons to Diane Rehm miss the point - nobody can compare to her! The show should be judged on its own merits. I enjoy it. That said, the incomplete podcast is a bit annoying.",4
Joshua Johnson is the best serious interviewer out there.,01/02/2019,eddie from seattle,The show is excellent. Thought provoking. Smart. I was worried when Diane left the air but Joshua filled her shoes quite well but he did not just follow her formula. He has brought his own thinking into the show and does that well.,5
Great news roundup!,01/12/2019,Lauren in Columbus,"I love the weekly news roundup. Smart, calm, measured, genuine. Great host, great guests. It’s part of my weekly routine!",5
Incredibly informative ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,01/15/2019,kirsten amber,"Varied, intelligent and interesting conversations about all manner of subjects. Above all, the hosting is second to none!",5
"Great show, podcast incomplete",01/24/2019,jelibeanpasadena,"I love the show, especially Joshua Johnson. I’m just disappointed that the podcast only plays 35 minutes of a 2 hour show. I really wish it could play all the discussion segments as I sometimes miss it live.",4
MIA,01/27/2019,Cindoc,"Like many other comments mention, where are the rest of the shows? Otherwise it’s usually very good content.",4
BEST QUALITY NEWS PROGRAM (on any platform),02/07/2019,hlharrower18,"Absolutely love this show. Love Jake Johnson, he may be the next great host for years to come. Not only does he bring in his own personality in very subtle, but needed ways, he also empathizes with many sides while also drawing the line on certain issues (not letting guests question scientific facts! THANK YOU). With their varied topics and respectful guests I feel like I get to learn about the world holistically. They talk about actual things that I am interested, and introduced me to things I never thought about before. If you listen to anything, listen to the Friday News roundup. Thanks 1A!",5
I miss Diane,02/09/2019,randyrisher,"Hey Joshua, you act like your listeners are morons. This is NPR, we are smarter than you. And can you stop with the high pitched squeaking at the end of sentences.",1
Disappointing,02/14/2019,EdtheDCguy,"I never thought I would delete WAMU's flagship podcast, but I am. I would like to hear more from the guests! If you tune in on 1A at any moment, you will get Joshua: Setting the stage for the rest of the show or the next series of questions, plugging an upcoming show and soliciting voice mails for it, reading a listener email or tweet, taking a call and then getting to know the caller, giving his take on the listener question, giving the guest a couple options of how she or he could answer a question. When the poor guest finally gets a chance to talk, he or she will blurt out a whole bunch of stuff, because it is a rare opportunity to talk. There is no flow. Instead of saying (as Diane did), ""Short break, right back,"" you will get instead a repetition of the guests' names and titles, a listener question to be answered after the break, then you get a break, and then after the break you get the same question you got before the break---plus Joshua's take on the question. This show needs to draw out the guests, with far, far fewer breaks in the action.",1
I tried to like this podcast.,02/18/2019,Abu Mahmoud1,"I downloaded the podcast because I miss TOTN, but after hearing the inaccuracies, misinformation and the same shallow negative narrative about life in Saudi Arabia I decided to unsubscribe. People shouldn’t be allowed to outright misinform others without being checked.",1
Host does his best to avoid bias,02/24/2019,Jschmee,Thank you for striving for unbiased reporting! Keep it up,5
Every day listener,03/01/2019,A-Schu,"Joshua Johnson is incredibly sharp, well spoken, and culturally savvy. He juggles wrangling his panelists and incorporating listener comments with charisma and finesse, all while injecting his unique personality and background. Though the show leans ideologically left, it remains one of the most politically neutral programs available today. It engages differing viewpoints while not shying away from calling out falsehoods and copouts. I loved the Diane Rehm Show and feel that 1A is a worthy follow up. We need more level-headed, in depth dialogue programs like 1A in the news. I’m able to listen almost every day, and wish the full show were published here so others could too!",5
Well rounded and fair,03/11/2019,O7diesel,"I like what is happening in this podcast, different points of view CIVILLY discussed. Not a bunch of nonsensical unproductive yelling. We need more peace and respect for differing opinions and each other in this Country, remember the old adage: United we stand, divided we fall.",5
Love it!!,03/11/2019,Ellerpea,"This is my favorite podcast! Joshua is very knowledgeable, fair in his presentation, and also fun and humorous! I’m always sad when he’s not there and there’s a sub, haha. My fave way of getting the news.",5
Incomplete,03/13/2019,DW-99,Why not post the entire two-hour show? This does not make any sense.,1
Where’s yesterday’s show?,03/14/2019,diodido,About autoimmune diseases. I could only catch a few minutes of it and promised myself I would listen to the podcast. No podcast! So disappointed.,2
Bad Faith,03/16/2019,Fyndhorn Joe,"While the title of the show indicates that these conversations welcome the freedom of speech, too often there are people representing bad faith agendas on an issue that get brought in and regarded with the same expertise as someone who has truly studied the issue for a long time. Despite Mr. Johnson being better at fact checking them on-air, when this has to happen it turns into a punching bag session and makes for cringeworthy listening.",2
Great show,08/24/2018,BangDingOw,"Good interviews, diverse perspectives, broad topics, a host with savvy and integrity. Podcast is half the show, and the full shows can be found on the website. The podcast of the roundup is the full two hours, and it’s the one I listen to most weeks.",5
Weak host,08/27/2018,pluperfect,I expected more from WAMU. Jackson is a weak host - so robotic in his delivery and so keen on false equivalencies. Even when he tries to be humorous it comes across as cringeworthy. I don’t get how he is still on the air. Such a disappointment because the show is well-produced and generally has great guests. I just can’t listen anymore because of Jackson.,1
Great podcast,09/10/2018,Bibi Jean,"Joshua holds back no punches, at times that’s my favorite part of listening to the episodes",5
9/11/18 Deep State,09/11/2018,cdrez,"Whoever the host was, never have them on again. Disgusting to hear FOX-like propaganda on an NPR podcast.",1
Why not the full show?,09/11/2018,JayJay85a,it easier to set up a playlist during my commute using an ipod than is it to have to use both my phone and the ipod becasue nonly half the show is available via a podcast,2
Journalistic interviews,09/17/2018,gerry shannon,"Host Josh Johnson is professional, intelligent and informed. He and staff have discussions of current and important topics. He has always done research on the topics discussed. He asks important and insightful questions of guests and allows them to answer. He will ask the right follow-up questions so guests are pressed to answer directly and not weasel out with an indirect and/or incomplete answer. I did not know of Johnson before this show but now glad that I do!",5
Love the podcast could be longer,09/21/2018,Ooommzzz,"Hi Joshua love your podcast. It is one of the best. You present such varied topics that are interesting and educative.
Politics / current affairs is being covered by so many and can get tiring and depressing, with all the negative things all the time from the current administration.",5
Moving toward “puff-piece” media,09/25/2018,cdv2016,"Need to engage both sides more often, like some older episodes. The frequency of extreme and biased guests has increased and the host does not engage serious opposing arguments. Don’t fall into the trap of “puff-piece” media. If you’re stepping on toes and sorting through the real arguments you’re on the right track.",2
Unbiased,09/30/2018,LLSSSTTTTT,"One of the very few NPR shows that truly tries to discuss all sides. Thank you, Joshua.",5
Well produced but shallow,10/01/2018,Tugger252,"A good podcast but largely uneven in viewpoints. Worth listening to, but plays into the echo chamber issue we have.",2
"Tasteless and Facile Pop Culture Coverage, Fair-ish Political Coverage",10/08/2018,kakarooku,Joshua Johnson and/or his team have no taste in art. It would be nice if they would dig even just a little below the obvious and most mass-market subjects when deciding what to report on. Their coverage is really bog-standard.,1
Part of my daily routine.,10/10/2018,KK_Slooper,"Another well-researched, well-produced, and always entertaining (and educational) podcast from NPR! On my top-ten list.",5
Still a Big Fan,10/19/2018,Listens Long,"I was a longtime listener of The Diane Rhem show, and worried that nobody could fill her shoes. Joshua, however has maintained the standard set by Diane of hosting an intelligent, relevant, fairly moderated discussion of current events. I still tune in every week! I especially love the Friday News Roundup with top notch reporters from Washington and around the world.",5
Favorite NPR Program,10/23/2018,Amrs049,Joshua Johnson is an amazing host. He is incredible at managing various perspectives with grace and dignity. I love learning from this podcast. 1A is absolutely my favorite NPR program.,5
Great show !,11/05/2018,Julanne the Anglophile,I like the current news analysis and the different viewpoints.,4
Interesting topics..,11/05/2018,celix22,"I feel like I have learned a great deal from this podcast, The topics are very interesting and informative. I like the way the hosts present the information.",5
No Full Show,11/07/2018,Mommyg22,"The lack of the full content of the 2 hour show is frustrating. I find Joshua more Partisan than Diane, but still like to get his show’s view. I just wish we got the whole view.",1
Please post the whole show,11/07/2018,Fan 2012,What is the reasoning for not posting the entire show?,1
Love,11/13/2018,LouluMassey,"Enjoy the host and his point of view, guest choice, humor and topic choice",5
Great Energy,12/08/2018,Rod Brown 4,I love J. Johnson's strong energy. Great pace for podcast.,5
The Facts Are Here,07/07/2018,Focus on this,Only people who don’t like the truth would call this show “Fake News”! Keep rolling out the facts like you do and ignore any ignorant ratings. Great shows!!!!,5
Love this podcast,07/11/2018,CLDCMAX,Love this podcast! Joshua Johnson is insightful and probing. I learn so much from listening every day!,5
"Every show is high in quality, depth & diversity",07/14/2018,DelBttrfly,"I am so thankful for 1A. It is both fun to listen to and incredibly educational. Every show is high in quality, depth & diversity, with its diversity being as to both guests and topics. Joshua Johnson’s 1A gives the WHOLE picture and all sides of the topic. I love the absence of drama and level emotions, while also am thankful for its comic relief that rises up organically at times. I’ll never win a bet on what topic will be covered next on non-Friday shows, but will every time on that it will be fascinating and accurate. And the Friday News Roundup is my saving grace for those weeks when I just can’t handle the stress of keeping up with the news, and/or for those months when work is so intense I simply don’t have the time. Joshua Johnson is an incredible and talented host who tries to downplay his brilliance but I am not fooled. ;) Along that line, congratulations on becoming a frequent and welcomed guest on Meet the Press! (I hope to see you even more on Sundays!) Not only does he thoroughly understand the topics and asks the questions that pull a deeper response, he is so skilled on gracefully maintaining order when discussions get heated and at keeping the pace going. (A good role model—I hope to gain from that too!) Thank you and keep up the great work!",5
This is my favorite show on NPR.,07/15/2018,FemmeFantastic,So much great conversation- and the 10-11pm timeslot on WABE is perfect. It’s a great end to the day.,5
best news host maybe ever??,07/15/2018,Anonymousez,"joshua johnson is one of the best news hosts to ever do it. his incredible professionalism and superb hosting skills are 90% of why i tune in each week. oh! i also love how audience input drives the conversation, and i love the broad range (often rarely talked about) of topics this shows covers, *especially* as it relates to people of color. keep at it, 1A team!",5
Great source for US and World News!,07/17/2018,JRinVirginia,"Joshua Johnson does an excellent job of interviewing guests and moderating panel discussion. The Friday News Round-up is a ""must listen"" for staying on top of the eading news stories in the US and around the world. Thanks to the 1A team for an excellent show.",5
I love this podcast!,07/18/2018,Roberta 1218,"The variety of topics, JJ as the moderator, and the excellent guests all make for an A plus podcast.",5
Good chat show.,07/18/2018,Jerome Stevenson,Joshua Johnson is a good host.,5
Great for a daily pulse on the nation,07/19/2018,cam328,I truly appreciate the commitment JJ and The 1A team have to allowing a multitude of voices to be heard while maintaining civility throughout the conversations. This is one of my favorite podcasts. Thanks for the work you do to bring such a wide variety of topics into public discourse.,5
1A,07/20/2018,jib59,Shame the quality of the panel members has deteriorated. I used to love this show but struggle now with the presenters who are often vague and muddled.,2
Love it!,07/24/2018,JDang2,Great topics and discussion. Thank you!,5
Joshua Johnson & team have nailed it!,07/25/2018,yredgerly,"I’m so proud of the way JJ & team have taken the mantle from DR Show and continued with intelligent & polite dialogue. Further, I’m delighted to hear someone who SOUNDS like me in a conversation show. Job well done",5
Post all the episodes!,07/26/2018,Ahc4959,I love this show and really appreciate how Joshua makes sure to try and remain as balanced as possible (though there’s definitely still a bit of a leftist bias). But I don’t bother listening to the podcast since left than half of the episodes are even posted! Until they do that I’m just going to listen through the webpage.,3
Great for news and general interest!,07/31/2018,npr_fan34,Great news program to be kept up to date on what’s going on at both a national and international level!,5
Awesome,08/01/2018,one of wokandas kings,Joshua you are the best.,5
Great Show,08/04/2018,nclettercarrier,Joshua Is a great moderator and does a good job bringing in multiple perspectives to subject material. It’s great that the show and host are not afraid of talking about difficult topics that are facing our nation/world. I appreciate that the moderator doesn’t rely solely on media experts and their opinions but rather utilizes diversity to bring different cultural perspectives to conversations.,5
Balanced news,08/05/2018,Nicki4713,I love this podcast. One of the things that got me hooked is that the news is actually being discussed without trying to persuade me to feel a certain way. I like how the host JJ asks questions and allow for answers and he corrects when needed. This is one of the best balanced news and entertainment news out there.,5
Great show but Missing segments,08/05/2018,ACRH1,I like 1A but am frustrated not to find segments that I heard on air... why not podcast the entire show and all segments?,3
Anything and Everything,08/09/2018,An0n26155,I love the variety of topics and the diversity of opinions that are presented. Also Joshua Johnson is an amazing host and moderator.,5

Too Left,05/11/2018,Yessssssssssssssir,Why is this NPR podcast so far left? Disappointing. Want unbiased news.,1
My favorite news and affairs show,05/12/2018,Clyde's dollface,"I really liked the Diane Rehm show, and doubted they would find a worthy successor. But Joshua Johnson is excellent: professional, intelligent, top-notch questioner, and a careful listener. He keeps his audience top of mind, and always is attuned to how they are hearing the program. It’s also obvious he has first-rate producers, clearly some of the best in the business.",5
Good work!,05/16/2018,Clint and Louise T,We’re enjoying the variety and scope of your programs and your personal insights about the topic at hand.,5
This team has a vision,05/20/2018,lebwh1,Making space to discover truth in civil conversation among smart people who disagree. It’s downright democratic.,5

This is my favorite show,05/24/2018,maren_j,I’ve never gotten into podcasts... I prefer to listen to my local station (WFSU) while I’m at home.,5
The favorite,06/02/2018,JUnit614,1A is by far my favorite podcast. Joshua always does a great job as host and seamlessly guides every episode through a well balanced and informative session.,5
Great Podcast,06/05/2018,WhittyO,"I love this show! Such a good mix of interesting information. The host is intelligent and respectful to each of his guests no matter their views. My favorite is the Friday news roundup because of the blend of national, international and entertainment news.",5
Too much energy.,06/09/2018,Wetstuff,"He tries to copy TV hosts. I listened to Diane Rheim (sp?) for many years. Maybe the age difference between them, but I listen to podcasts rather than NPR. Jim/Maryland",2
The true “Fresh Air” on radio,06/19/2018,Hansola1,Joshua Johnson should be acknowledged and credited for hosting the most impartial radio show currently airing in this country. I listen everyday and learn something everyday.,5
The best podcast,06/27/2018,Natalie c número UNO,"I love this podcast because it tackles such a variety of different topics, always with respect to different views and people. From drag queens to octopuses to income inequality, everyone can learn something. I love the style of Joshua and am always sad when he is not there. He has an intellectual, fresh, fun, and relevant take on each topic. He handles the many types of interviewees with ease! I can’t recommend this enough!",5
Civility,06/27/2018,DLMCHB,Bravo to Joshua on keeping a very provocative topic on track. You showed a balanced combination of control yet respect for a wide variety of passionate views. You must have been exhausted at the end of the hour! Love your podcast no matter what the topic!,5
Too Balanced,06/28/2018,American92,"I used to like this show a lot, but after listening to it for about a year, you start to realize that balance isn’t necessarily fair or just. It just seems like Joshua is trying to make everyone happy for ratings.",1
Best Part of My Day,06/28/2018,ELMurphh,I appreciate this podcast to no end. Joshua is my favorite host of any type of all time. He makes this podcast insightful and enjoyable. I am continually impressed with his breadth of knowledge and ability to navigate such a large range of topics with ease. Please take a listen!,5
Civility moderator lost it,06/30/2018,all...ears,Issue needs mod who is untriggered by facts,4
Unequivocally great pod,07/01/2018,DawnsFishies,"Only complaint is I wish you got more right-leaning guests. However, I imagine this is in part not for lack of trying, and in part because it’s easier to highlight the party out of power.",5
Civility??,07/05/2018,Salted Apple,"The “Civility” episode was anything but. Joshua’s lack of composure and unprofessional behavior was appalling. If he felt as though the panelists views were painting an unflattering portrait with biased, broad strokes - then that should have been respected as her position and not his to defend, offend or shout down. He was emotional and unhinged. I will stick with Terry Gross.",1
1A,07/06/2018,doyouwantmyopinion,"I always learn something. and if I listen to a podcast and don't learn anything, I delete it. I have never deleted any one of Joshua's podcasts.",5
I love it,03/30/2018,DamieniPhone,Keep it up!,5
Devil's Advocate or Clueless?,04/01/2018,Kit Kat Cad,"The host baits his interviewees with questions that cater to our thirst for Red vs Blue blood and in his own editorializing it's sometimes hard to tell if he's playing the devil's advocate or if he's truly that clueless (either way, not good for radio where a lot of nuance is lost). This show is OK, but there are a ton of news and interview podcasts out there that are better than what 1A offers with its current host.",3
"Super Leftist, But Trues to be Fair",04/03/2018,getsomenick,"This show looks at news-ish topics from an extremely Leftist perspective. However, most episodes have a good conservative/libertarian perspective represented. It’s a good source for balance with something the “The Federalist “ podcast, for example.",4
Ugh.,04/04/2018,cemipi,"Stop interrupting your guests.

Also, I understand wanting both sides represented in the conversation but your constant need to play devils advocate tends to take away from the conversation rather than adding to it.",2
Not well rounded,04/06/2018,THL747,"I understand that this podcast is mainly people’s opinions, but could we get more facts? Seems biased. Could be more well rounded to show more than one point of view",1
Great find,04/07/2018,Bligblog,Was really turned on to this show by the excellent interview with Tom Peters which I’ve passed along to my team. Then the show covering girls’ confidence is also a winner. Typically great NPR content.,5
Refreshing Podcast!,04/08/2018,Chickenlover200,Nice balance between news and variety. Joshua Johnson is an NPR rising journalist/host.,5
Perfect Timing,04/10/2018,princess boi,"I don't always have time for the full show. I love that the podcaast is a little shorter than the complete show, but somehow I don't feel like I'm missing too much. It is a perfect amount of time to listen while I ride my bike to work.",4
Great show,04/14/2018,rsharrell,"Joshua Johnson is doing a fine job. Yes, we all love Diane and can still listen to her on her podcast. But Joshua is his own person and brings his own gifts and experience. Besides, Diane enthusiastically endorsed him before her show ended. Let’s allow him to be who he is and appreciate what he brings to the world of news panels and commentary.",5
"Love Friday, but the rest of the week....",04/15/2018,JCChuck1958,"Honestly, this is one of my favorite podcasts. My only complaint is that the Monday through Thursday feeds are extremely limited, always just one segment of the complete show. PLEASE, make the entire broadcast available to your listeners.",4
Al!,04/15/2018,fauxfish!,"Al, this may be reminiscent of your love note to Terri Gross... I love you! For real though, Al Lettson is an amazing reporter and creator. Listen to all he makes, including Reveal - excellent and engaging and told in a way that makes me wanna listen!",5
Versatile,04/17/2018,everyday listener 2,"I am never bored, Joshua can take on any topic, from race to international news. Keep up the great work!",5
Brilliant host,04/18/2018,Nikkiadrienne,"Joshua is incredibly smart. He is a great listener which interviewers often are not. Follows up guests answers with insightful questions and comments. Incredibly knowledgeable and well researched. Stepped into Diane’s shoes nicely, and then some.",5
Very good show,04/20/2018,sharl001,I like it. A lot. I loved Diane too but all good things have to come to an end some time. So glad you were able to take her spot. Your shows are always timely and interesting.,5
Phenomenal podcast on wide range of issues!,04/24/2018,Pup876,"Joshua Johnson and 1A provide an exceptionally high quality examination and disucssion of a wide-range of issues -- he is extremely knowledgable and thougthful and asks very tough, thought-provoking questions to offer a balanced and nuanced exploration of topic!",5
Carefully balanced and not afraid to address explosive controversies! A must-listen,04/26/2018,Psnyder709,"1A is a daily 2-hour show that promotes civil discourse about controversial topics. Although we all bring our biases, Jeremiah Johnson works hard to listen to his guests and delve deep. Unafraid to admit his own biases, he explores the views and feelings behind today’s hot issues. Listen for a few days and you’ll be rewarded with a careful analysis.",5
My most listened to Podcast,04/27/2018,Hengyang,"I am a fan!!! Story’s are interesting, well researched & not stuffy",5
Love me some JJ!,04/29/2018,SWerMagen,"Diane Rhem left big shoes to fill, for sure. Joshua Johnson has not just stepped into those shoes, he has remade them in a marvelous way. It is still a very good news show with interesting features.",5
Loving this podcasts from a podcast fanatic,04/30/2018,ModernSouthernGirl,I learn so much from your show. This show provides me more insights then my local news show. Thank you for the great reporting and insights.,5
No wisdom. Not talking about the issues,05/02/2018,notsoemogirl,"- hate that they only take prerecorded calls or tweets

Great show,02/23/2018,Irish Spud,"Joshua is one of the best NPR newsmen in the business. Bringing good fresh topics with high quality experts. Check it out, a great show to keep up on news and learn new items and topics. Please though put BOTH daily shows on the podcast app! It will be a huge help to all us millennials!",5
Finding Footing,02/24/2018,Craberry,"Been listening since day one – – JJ is great. I especially enjoy the Friday round up and look forward to it every week. Like Diane, JJ seems to frequently know as much as or more than his guests and that’s great. Brilliant podcast.",5
Regular listener doing a cringe,02/25/2018,akaagentk,"I have been listening to 1A every day for a long time. I love Joshua's fair handed approach and balanced coverage of topics. BUT today I listened to FEBRUARY 20, 2018 ""The Future of Humanity"" with Michio Kaku. Why did you let this lunatic carry on for the whole show without any counterpoint of rationality? Futurists are not in the business of building rational scenarios. They make stuff up, but it entertains people and so they can make a living selling books. I am a Mechanical Engineering professor working on energy transition and I have to deal with the real world 100% of the time. I don't know how to express to you how cringe worthy your coverage of this Futurist was because you presented him as an actual scientist or technology expert which he is not. Maybe you need to explore the whole genre of Futurism and see what it really is. It is entertainment, like science fiction.",4
How “fair and balanced should be”,02/25/2018,M3appaholic,"With a smart, well read host, 1A delivers the fair and balanced news that we wish cable media could provide. While giving a voice to all sides of arguments, JJ is great about calling out BS when it pops up. Fair and balanced is possible without pandering, and this podcast is a shining example of that.",5
Great Show Great Ideal,02/27/2018,Concerned Housing Provider,I really enjoy listening to 1A. The show is very thought provoking and comprehensive in its coverage of stories. I would like to hear a show on the massive problem of Afforable Housing in American and the HUGE problem that will be exacerbated by the TRUMP Tax cut. The tax bill will serve a death blow to affordable housing because of the lack of Low Income Housing Tax credits(LIHTC),5
No more tears,03/09/2018,nolan301,"I was in tears when Diane left.. until I heard 1A. This is simply the best show on radio.
I’m a snowbird . In PA(WHYY) it is on only one hour. In SW FL (WGCU ), both segments are on each day.",5
Meh,03/10/2018,Rekinu,"I was hoping for a party-free discussion, and was sorely disappointed. You can tell the left tilt on this show without hardly any hiding of the fact. They pretend, by going to the RNC a couple episodes back, but the majority of those they interview are clearly elitist leftist, and when they do have a libertarian or conservative on, its one of four, and hardly given the same attention. I find myself just deleting about a third of the podcasts due to lack of interest. I start listening to it, and can’t stand the obvious slant they are",1
Always a fan,03/13/2018,Amy Abroad,"I’ve been listening to 1A from the beginning: first live on WUNC and now via podcast since we moved overseas. I learn something — new information, new perspectives — with every episode. Joshua Johnson strikes a good balance of soliciting various viewpoints where reasonable people can disagree, while engaging the topic through his own lens and experience. I really appreciate the variety of topics — including (as NPR is beloved for generally) topics I never would have sought out on my own or known I should care about. With each episode I feel a little more knowledgeable and a lot more curious about the theme. As others noted, I really miss the 2-hour format — more content please! And keep up the great work. - Amy B., Germany",5
I recommend this show to everyone,03/15/2018,Libra9300,They do a great job of articulating different ideas. Presenting different views and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of all.,5
Beautifully brings many viewpoints together,03/15/2018,KatieC25,"I love listening to 1A on NPR but when I miss it live, I’m so glad I can find it here. When discussing topics they bring (or at least truly try) to get all viewpoints to speak, and not just screaming at each other. I feel like I not only understand the topics better but also the viewpoints that are not like my own.",5
Love the M-Th podcasts!,03/16/2018,GalInSeattle,"I love this show, and love Joshua Johnson's balanced, smart interview style! I don't love the Friday news roundups, however. I skip them, always. By the time the week is over, and Trump has set his sights on Mar-a-Lago, I've already heard the daily news from 19 different directions on a daily basis. Please give us something short, and bright and fresh to listen to on Friday. We deserve a break, a human interest story, perhaps? Rehashing the week's awful news over 90 minutes just isn't doing it for me.",4
No longer a valid news source.,03/17/2018,chburnell,This once valuable program has become a spokes organ for the White House. Count me out.,1
Love it!,03/19/2018,book bartender,My favorite way to get news.,4
Hooray for deep dives!,03/21/2018,Rachie456,I appreciate the time spent delving into each topic and the contributions of subject matter experts. Thanks Joshua for cultivating a space for both agreeing and dissenting voices.,5
Always on point,03/22/2018,Alessandra Nardi,Thanks Joshua for being the new power force in the news radio bringing us up to date facts and solid questions. Keep strong for us!,5
Solid and well-balanced,03/23/2018,Michelle Cohrene,Solid reporting that makes a valiant attempt at finding a balance of views without “being so open mined your brain falls out.”,4
Favorite news podcast,03/24/2018,StefSchui,"I listen to 1A every day. I like the well informed guests, the many women guests, and the range of topics. I’m able to stay off internet news sites that cater to manipulating emotions as a way to gain readership. Keep up the great work JJ!!",5
mind-opening,03/24/2018,Embgj,"I loved Diane Rheem, her diplomacy, the respect she showed her interviewees and her dignity.
And I have grown to love JJ for different reasons. He goes right to the quick of topics (like the meaningfulness of hazing), he sometimes shares his own reactions as a Black gay man (which as a white woman I really appreciate hearing), and addresses topics I never thought i would hear on radio, like the politics of periods :) .",5
Don’t sound hesitant!,03/25/2018,Syntax Babe,"I love this podcast. Joshua Johnson asks probing questions and interviews important people. One suggestion: Mr. Johnson says “kind of” quite often, sometimes twice in the same sentence. Makes it sound like you’re nervous. No need to be!",4
Love the Podcast. but why only one hour?,03/30/2018,J A Campo,Love the show it is two hours long but we only get one hour on podcast?,4
Octopuses,01/10/2018,TMH3,I regularly listen to 1A. The data is objective & all sides get their chance to discuss topics. My favorite thus far has been the episode about octopuses. The guests were down to earth & informative. Thank you.,4
Interesting and engaging,01/19/2018,JuliaS12000,"I listen to 1A on my drive to work and it makes the commute sim much more enjoyable. The conversations, discussions, and debates held on this show are always thoughtful, balanced, and interesting. They do a great job of covering a wide range of topics, there's something here for everyone.",5
Very informing,01/21/2018,Forthetokens10286299727,"Joshua does a great job, and I love the breadth and diversity of topics he covers.",5
Pompous and arrogant reporting from the left,01/22/2018,Tool4daman,"Fake news and left news. If you like your news from one single point of view that reinforces your left viewpoint, then this is for you. I’ve subscribed to this podcast for approximately six months, and have seen little to no balanced reporting in that time. This podcast is carrying on the NPR flag of discrimination against conservatives. No wonder why congress seeks to defund them every few years. But its ok- they’re enlightened.",1
1A,01/23/2018,Mary from Minnesota (MPR),"I couldn’t disagree more with LibScott. I think Joshua Johnson is amazing. He picks timely topics, asks thoughtful questions and invites articulate guests on both sides. He clearly prepares well but is very adept at changing course to explore a different question or observation. I also saw him live in Minneapolis and felt even more respect for him.",4
Vital podcast for our changing world,01/23/2018,Bittersweet Milk,I like that the show features a variety of topics and guests. Host Joshua Johnson masterfully moderates the conversation so that every voice is heard. The podcast is vital to the growing world that feels erratic at times.,4
Daily listener,01/24/2018,astnlgsn,This is my favorite daily podcsst. Joshua Johnson covers a vast array of global issues and always pulls in a diverse guest panel to add dynamic perspectives.,5
Great Format - Great Content,01/24/2018,Matt from Portland,I originally caught Jeremiah on a panel discussion and was impressed by his ability to call people out and avoid a partisan tug of war. He challenged everyone on the panel but wasn’t a jerk! I have listened to several of these and I love the format and the thoughtful dialogue. Great show!,5
Not the full show,01/24/2018,Littlepoison-WA,The podcast only gives part of the whole show. Today’s podcast was only 11 minutes long. Give us the whole hour or two!,2
Great Show,01/25/2018,ConorJMayhem,"Love the format, Joshua Johnson is a master juggler",5
Please offer full episodes!,01/26/2018,Amyvt98,"I love the show and enjoy listening to the parts made available on iTunes, but I’d love to be able to listen to full episodes, too! I work during the day and am rarely able to tune in for the entire show.",4
Refreshing,01/26/2018,gabby1130,Thanks for a balanced show Joshua. Nice to hear all voices on various subjects.,5
Part of my daily routine,01/30/2018,JPAuyer,Having to drive almost an hour to-and-from work through rural Vermont is evermore enjoyable listening to 1A. I appreciate the variety of panelists and viewpoints that are expressed; that Joshua Johnson is willing to push back (and take criticism) from guests and listeners; and that interesting and unexpected show topics come up. It is defintely part of my daily routine. Make it part of yours.,5
"Great Podcast, but..",02/01/2018,KatMer5,"I listen to this podcast regularly, and love that it tackles such a wide variety of topics. However, I have to take off a star in response to today's episode on the necessity of supplements. Not 5 minutes in, Joshua Johnson pauses the discussion to play a clip from Aziz Ansari's Master of None about working out/body image, no mention of supplements. You would think with the dialogue around Ansari and the MeToo movement, the inclusion of the clip would have been more thought out, especially as there are many other (and perhaps more relevant) pop culture references to body obsession that could have been used. Just left a bitter taste in my mouth.",4
More critical thinking?,02/03/2018,gbaptista,"I like Joshua’s show when he opens the mic to the guests. The topics are great but I feel there is a lack of critical thinking. Joshua, could you please be more incisive? Many NPR donators will appreciate it. Thanks, dude!",2
Melania trump...,02/03/2018,knowitall12,"Why even do the story. YOu did nearly a half hour show on Melanie Trump. NOthing new, nothing unusual, nothing. Why even bother doing the show? I feel a though you wasted my time, and ended the show acting like you had created such enlightenment. What a waste of good air time. It wasn't the subject, it was the journalist or lack of one on this show.",1
Always informative,02/09/2018,YoginiJenn,Love 1A - great variety of topics; always intelligently presented.,5
Perfection,02/11/2018,Team Sigel,"It is safe to say I have an intellectual crush on Joshua Johnson. He asks tough questions, demands answers that don’t skirt around the question, and works hard to provide objective information. He also does a great job of getting at the intersection of the different identities in a very meaningful way.",5
Love 1A,02/13/2018,lasifantas,Lots of good topics and thanks for keeping Friday Round Up!,5
JKC1,02/16/2018,phxclark5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Friday News Round-Up!
Joshua Johnson has done a GREAT job continuing Diane Rehm’s work. This podcast always has excellent, interesting and current programming. I highly recommend this podcast.",5

Class act,11/20/2017,Pordy90,20+ year Diane Rehm listener and was prepared to not like this. By summer I was hooked (and wnyc AM just took it away :(,5
Love the show,11/20/2017,Critime,This is an intelligent conversation that is balanced. Sorry but I don’t miss Diane because she was sometimes caustic and critical of her guests opinions.,5
Love the 1A Podcast.,11/26/2017,JohneL,Joshua Johnson is doing a fantastic job of ‘picking up and running with the ball’ from beloved Dianne Roehm. His background and knowledge of different communities relevant to our changing society is a welcome change. I especially appreciate his keeping the guests from drifting into perhaps unfamiliar jargon and acronyms keeping all the listeners on the same page.,5
Great show but missing episodes!!,12/11/2017,Annalynne_Genevieve,"I got hooked onto 1a this summer when I used to listen to it during my hour long commute to university. Love the show and the content! Joshua Johnson is an amazing broadcaster and host. He shows respect to all of his guests and tries to make sure every side of the story is shown which I greatly appreciate. However, I'm really not happy that only a few select episodes get uploaded!! Why?? For those who can't listen live (which is a large majority of the population) downloading them is super convenient, why wouldn't you want all of your content readily available? You'll reach more viewers! That's the only reason for the one star I deducted. Get it together Josh!!",4
Denny,12/13/2017,Denny Catlett,"This podcast, which is a great concept, has gotten worse recently. When it first started they posted only one hour of the show on the podcast. That is now down to a half hour or less on somedays. If NPR or the producers don’t want to make a full podcast available they should stop posting it.",1
"Good subjects, Poor prep",12/15/2017,debanndg,"I like the subjects, but I don't think that Joshua does his homework on the issues. He doesn't challenge his guest when they say things that aren't true or are questionable. He also doesn't bring up key issues that should be addressed. For instance, on Net Neutrality, he didn't challenge Pai on issues such as increases in cost to individual users. Also, he has so many guests that they rarely have time to cover issues in any depth. So much time is spent introducing them. Like the show, but needs some work.",3

Keep it up!,12/17/2017,MattyCabie,"Great show, amazingly intelligent host and extremely informative. Keep up the great work.",5
1A is Great and,12/18/2017,Ray D from NY,I am a fan if 1 A and would encourage others to listen. I enjoy the pod regularly on NPR One and really enjoy the in depth discussions of current and past events through the lens of Free Speech/ the First Amendment.,4
Even better than the predecessor,12/19/2017,Indiananative,"Joshua Johnson is incisive, intelligent, and does an excellent job of keeping his guests on topic. His questions are so insightful, but keep the conversation grounded in reality. And the range of topics and guests is so diverse. Best talk show on NPR.",5
The best,12/20/2017,Swoody813,"If I could give this show 6 or 7 stars I would. Joshua Johnson is so intelligent, thoughtful, and thought-provoking as a host. His commitment to diversity and inclusivity is exemplary. His guests are sometimes wonderful and sometimes infuriating, but he is always able to get something out of them that benefits the listener. I have learned so much from this pod, and I recommend it to everyone that asks me about pods.",5
Too much BS goes unchallenged,12/22/2017,Yet another David,"Critical thinking is in shorter supply than it used to be when this time slot was Diane Rehm's, and that's too bad. I had high hopes for this host.",2
Awesome,12/26/2017,Raecrob5235,Rarely go a day without listening. Enjoy the wide range of topics and feel JJ makes a strong attempt to showcase multiple opinions and voices. Please keep up the great work.,5
An Excellent Podcast,12/27/2017,Sally D.,"Knowing Diane Rhem to be irreplaceable, I dutifully tuned in to 1A for the Friday news Roundup, and only sporadically picked up other shows, based on how interesting I thought the topic would be. I found Joshua Johnson to be competent, prepared, balanced, and curious. As the months have passed, though, I find myself listening to 1A almost daily, and not because of the topics. Joshua Johnson has increasingly found his voice, which is funny, passionate, and driven to excel. And in finding his voice, he has found me as a devoted listener. I look forward to many years of having mental windows thrown open by this podcast and the world brought into a broader perspective by Mr. Johnson’s zeal to explore and explain it.",5
Diane is gone,12/28/2017,Noonepleasehavethisname,1A is what was needed. NPR was too white and too old. The new host does a much better job of calling out the left and right leaning guests for their biased opinions. It’s great when he asks tough questions to liberal guests when Diane would have sided with them or given them a pass for their comments.,4
"The more I listen, the more I like 1a",12/29/2017,donna ree row,"Good questions, good guests.",5
Tell me when the whole episodes get released,01/02/2018,EdgarSonneborg,"Based on the number of reviews saying that it is incomplete because it is truncated, I'm not even going to try to subscribe to it. Advertise when you decide to release the whole conversation.",3
Amature,01/03/2018,Lefkalc,"Joshua talks to his audience as if they are stupid. He talks so slow and disconnected and he breaks things down far too much it implies that the listeners intelligence is that of an elementary school student. He also leaves no mystery to radio; saying things like, we’re going to break in a minute, or I know we have to break in a minute, really bursts the magic of radio. The listener has no idea of this break, so don’t give it away. Joshua also does not let his guests have the limelight. The show is about the topic and not the host. He also silences his guests mics so they can’t jump in. Often the guests are far more knowledgeable about the topic than the host, don’t stifle that intelligence! Sometimes I listen and think, wow this guest is at the top of his/her field and I am not able to hear a full thought by this guest because Joshua keeps interrupting and redirecting the topic and often tossing to another guest. I can only assume that he is insecure about the topic or intelligence that he can’t keep up. It’s ok if you don’t know everything the guest knows, that’s why you have a guest. I really hope you’re able to take the comments with a grain of salt since it’s been a long time coming for me to write his review. A lot of this can be fixed by taking a deep breath and relaxing before the interview. Talk less, interrupt less and have more faith in yourself and the show. The host is nervous and it shows.",2
"Poignant, purposeful, and to the point.",01/08/2018,Walkebb,"Joshua Johnson does an excellent job parsing the current events of today, and the program has an equally excellent knack for inviting compelling correspondents on for viewpoint from people close to the topics.",5
A must listen!,10/19/2017,aparrott85,I have found this podcast about a year ago and I have enjoyed the range and depth of the reporting. Joshua Johnson does a great job hosting the podcast.

"Good work, Joshua!",10/21/2017,lstovel,"1A is broadcast on KQED too late for me to listen, and the podcast as a whole is too time-consuming, so I listen to KQED’s announcement of the topic, then go find that issue of the podcast when I can. Joshua is doing a great job handling a variety of topics. And the topics are current and interesting. I do wish that occasionally he would get back to the original concept of 1A.",5
Lots of viewpoints,10/21/2017,TXSmo,"I appreciate all the effort 1A puts into getting guests with differing viewpoints and opinions. It’s refreshing to hear some civilized conversations about hard topics from different points of view, and without the drama! Thank you Joshua, 1A, and NPR!",5
The conservations we should be having.,10/21/2017,NRD90,"1A is forward thinking and hosts the conversations the popular media tend to miss. Over the past year WE have talked about PrEP, gun ownership (not just gun violence), and RTV (just to name a few). JJ gets all sides of the conversations and we get to hear from the source. Love this show and JJ is incredible. Wish I had as much confidence and sass as him.",5
Fantastic show but,10/22/2017,lscho,"The podcast doesn’t have the entire radio show. I can’t always catch 1a live so I wish the whole show was podcasted. 1a is thoughtful, balanced and insightful on various topics.

A great new show,10/22/2017,McDale,"I’m really impressed by Joshua Johnson. Excellent questions. Interesting guests. While the Friday show with the wrap-up of the news is my favorite, I listen every day. Well done.",5

Outstanding show!,11/13/2017,Uneedthis,"On a recent car trip I was able to get my Fox listening, Trump supporting brother to listen to the show with me & he was impressed by the unbiased, non spin coverage of the issues covered that day. 1A helps you to be more informed & to have intelligent conversations about all of the important issues we are currently facing. Keep up the great work!",5
1A,11/14/2017,Pitterpat80,Joshua Johnson asks intelligent and thoughtful questions in a wide range of pertinent topics! I find myself wanting to listen to his discussions even while I workout.,5
One star ratings and reviews are whack,11/17/2017,graham.i.am,"The cellar of “fake” news believers is starting to drive me crazy. 1A keeps the conversation bipartisan and is very inclusive to each side of the debate. When people and companies decide to reject invitations to go on the show, it should really put into question the authenticity of what they truly believe in and stand for if they are unwilling to defend it on a bipartisan public platform.",5
Waste of air time,11/17/2017,Mary Jeffco,There’s way too much Joshua and very little discussion. This 2 hour time slot was important when Diane or her guest hosts worked it. Now it’s gone from knowledgeable discussion to drivel.,1

This show caught my attention but I dropped it after a while because it didn't seem have have variety of deep topics. I've recently caught a few episodes that have been very enjoyable and focused on arts and science. I don't just come here for news but I do enjoy the roundup style news 1A posts.

The strength of the Diane Rehm show to me was always the format, not the main host (sorry, folks--I thought Indira Lakshmanan and Susan Page were better than Diane Rehm).

Joshua Johnson and Diane Rehm,09/24/2017,HappyNG,"I have been an avid listener of the Diane Rehm Show for the past 15 years and was saddened to see her retire. When I first started listening to the 1A Show by Joshua Johnson I was definitely a sceptic. How can ANYONE replace La Grande Dame of the most defying and newsworthy podcast of all? Well, after many months of listening, I can sincerely say that Monsieur Johnson is indeed a most talented and astute moderator with a wealth of knowledge of his captivating topics and high-quality guests. I am now a true believer of Monsieur Joshua Johnson.",5
Expends,09/26/2017,Blindsighted,Great show...a fantastic expansion on its predecessor “the Diane Rehm Show”. Joshua is able to reach an audience Diane was not able to reach (not due to lake of ability) hence the show has generated some fantastic interviews audiences would otherwise never get. One such interview is Gucci Mane. Fantastic show.,5
Love 1a and Joshua Johnson,10/05/2017,1a FAN,"I was such a Diane Rehm fan for years that I couldn’t imagine anyone filling her shoes.

I can't understand the few negative reviews,10/05/2017,Al Kelson,"complaining of this being cut or in some ways ""incomplete."" The entire podcast may occasionally exceed an hour.

Joshua is well-rounded and I am doing my part to share the show with people of my age and demographic who may not have listened in the past.,5
Feet to the fire,10/17/2017,mcintj,"Joshua, I loved your interview with Maniforts lawyer. You are very clear in diction and content as you pose questions to your guest. Thanks for holding his feet to the fire so skillfully. It was refreshing and empowering.",4
1A is a solid show...with room to grow,06/08/2017,jklued,"Rome wasn't built in a day and Diane Rehm didn't become a national treasure in 6 months. 1A will be a very good podcast...but it has some room to grow. Topics are diverse and far-reaching. I actually like that they don't put the whole 2-hour show. I struggle with finding time with all my other podcasts to listen to even 60-minute shows. The Weekly Roundup is their most popular and a great way to catch up if hitting the road or cooking on a Friday evening after work! Enjoy and welcome Joshua Jackson, keep up the great work!",3
Where is the rest?,06/09/2017,Andy7567,"There is no reason why the whole broadcasted show isn't being uploaded as a podcast. I'm not going to listen to it live as it doesn't fit my schedule. And no, I'm not going to listen to it on your website. Why annoy the fanbase that the wonderful Diane Rehm built for you by delivering an unaccountably abridged product?",1
"Great, and unique",06/09/2017,-SNO,"It's not always what's in the news and I love that.
The weekly podcasts that dive into topics that may or may not be 'hot' in the news are a great break from the constant political reality-TV show like reporting.",5
Thought Provoking,06/10/2017,Trattler,I am a regular listener to 1A (and the podcast) because I find Joshua and his selected journalist guests provide both great questions and interesting insights on the issues they tackle. I also love the diversity of topics that the show covers. I especially love seeing how Joshua has gotten comfortable with where he is wanting each show to go and his style is refreshing (equal parts smart and cool). THANK YOU for this option for my limited listening time.,5
If they only kept the Friday News Roundup,06/10/2017,Chaucersdog,"The Friday News Round Up was the only radio/podcast that I considered ""must listen."" 1A seems to think that they are improving on it with new formats and even not using a balanced panel of reporters. The program is no longer on my must listen list. It may be deleted from my podcast list soon.",2
Worthy successor,06/14/2017,MettaKaruna,"Hosted by Joshua Johnson, this is a worthy successor to Diane Rehm’s beloved long-running NPR daily program. Compared to Rehm’s show, 1A thus far appears to be more focused on race, gender, and identity, and to be pitched toward a younger audience. Particularly recommended is the Friday News Roundup, a single 1.5-hour file that is split between domestic and international news, each with a panel of three invited journalists.",5
The most relevant news show,06/22/2017,Amihatt,"I love that 1A focuses on the bigger issues behind the news. Joshua Johnson calls out the rhetoric in the week's journalism and politics, and he always asks his panel to get down to specific, verifiable claims. I appreciate that 1A always has at least one woman on the panel, but I do wish the panelists talked about the role of race and gender in every issue a little more. Overall, it is the most informative news source that I subscribe to and is one of my models for great journalism.",5
Superb Show / Podcast,07/02/2017,Random Modnar,"Joshua Johnson has made this space his own from the very start. He is the best radio host I have heard (and I'm a fan of Tom, Terry and many others). He is bright, attentive and so good at getting from one panelist to another, from one topic to another. He's so good you don't even notice how good he is ... other hosts have techniques for tapering off one caller, pitching to a panelist or interviewee, etc. With Johnson, you don't even see the mechanics, you just flow along an interesting and informative stream of conversation. And his goodwill and decency are manifest. Love this new show!",5
Great podcast,07/12/2017,GUPrepster411,Highly recommend,5
Disgrace,07/22/2017,Spencer19070,I've never done a podcast but this is just shameful... rushed conversations and prerecorded voicemails are not a sound replacement to Diane rehm,1
Many shows not loaded to iTunes,07/23/2017,MiRiWi,"1) This potentially excellent show has two episodes each day, only some of them are put on iTunes. I would like to be able to choose which ones I listen to. Theyare all available on the website, but I use iTunes.",3
Love this podcast.,07/25/2017,Beckinak,"Measured, thoughtful and allows dissenting views. Greatly appreciate this being in my podcast feed.",5
definitely has improved since beginning,08/01/2017,Great711,"this podcast certainly has matured Ther have been some topics that I could not last 5 minutes with but now months later, I look forward to the venues. Friday's news roundup is quite good and the recent program on the Aspen Festival public input was ingenious. now the hope is consistency.",4
Incomplete,08/02/2017,Mjb4987,"Very good content, but why isn't the full show being offered?",2
"Want all shows, full shows, and less fluff",08/03/2017,incoherent1,"They're currently only posting some shows (not all), and when they do, it's a partial show, rather than the full episode. It's also very inconsistent. Some episodes are posted quickly while others take more time. The DRShow would post full episodes of both shows within a couple hours of air time. Every single day.",2
Mediocre Attempt to Fill Diane Rehm's Role,08/07/2017,KingCharlesXVI,"WAMU lost a legend of the microphone with Diane Rehm last winter, and to fill her daily time slot, Joshua Johnson was picked to command the public radio morning airwaves. Johnson's 'playful, down to earth' approach comes off disingenuous and insincere. I, myself, am a millennial, and it seems Johnson was chosen to speak to my audience. But he fails miserably to be taken serious. Looking for a new pod? Skip this one.",2
"Skeptical at first, but stay tuned in",08/12/2017,Egomanical,"At first I wasn't so sure about 1A. Hard to follow Diane Rehm, but kept downloading & listening periodically. Now love this show as much as the DR show. Joshua Johnson has entered the precious time slot occupied by one voice in exchange for his voice. Just what I was looking toward to, high quality material & discussion with a broad spectrum of expertise represented.",5
Love the weekly news round up,08/12/2017,Frugal Elf,"Every show is great, but my favorite is the extensive weekly news roundup (every Friday). I recommend this show for anyone who likes; To The Point, On Point or Left Right and Center.",5
Love this show,08/14/2017,mbnystrom,Joshua Johnson is part of my daily routine- can't wait to listen to his excellent commentary on so many salient issues domestic and international!,5
Great news podcast,08/15/2017,Gnomer84,I love this podcast's deep-dives into the news. Always interesting interviews and discussions.,5
"Many perspectives, varying topics...",05/08/2017,MCR6488,"Really appreciate how many perspectives Joshua Johnson brings on the show. I'd like to hear a few more thoughtful conservative viewpoints, but overall he is great at this. Joshua Jackson considers all viewpoints and asks questions that I'm thinking and questions that I'm not--and he is not afraid of the answer.",5
Joshua Johnson Leads a respectful conversation on topics that matter!,05/09/2017,RayTay718,"This podcast, and its host, facilitate meaningful conversation about current events and issues. It is respectful and intelligent. The guests are always interesting and insightful, whether or not I agree with their stance. I love listening!",5
Good info.,05/13/2017,smellie_bellie,I love mostly all of the 1A podcasts. Sometimes gets a little talking-over-each-other arguing-y but other wise a great podcast and good topics.,4
Love the Friday News Roundup,05/13/2017,MedStudentForevs,One of the best unbiased new sources available.,5
Friday news roundup is my go-to,05/14/2017,Musikiscool,The news cycle is boggling. The Friday round-up gives me the week's headlines with knowledgeable experts and no cable news sensationalism,5
Very informative,05/15/2017,greencrazymel,Unaware that show has been abridged. My experience is enlightening and entertaining. Thanks,4
Five Stars: Friday News Roundup has found it's legs...,05/15/2017,Christopher126,Just excellent! (Good to hear Yoki again!),5
Joshua Johnson is terrific,05/20/2017,NJL1964,"I think Joshua Johnson does a great job of moderating intelligent, well-informed, civil conversation. He takes on tough topics and is always mindful and respectful of his listeners.",5
Disgust,05/21/2017,LawDawgKMK,You go on with praising Ailes. There is a very special place in hell for anyone who associates greatness with a person (not to mention an entire network) who disrespects and belittles women and minorities. Unsubscribe,1
Terrific,05/21/2017,Mukkuroni,"Joshua Johnson is a huge improvement in Diane Rehm. Unlike the others giving feedback, I was not a huge fan of hers, I thought she was sort of dumb and self-regarding. I think Joshua asks very good questions, does his homework, and I for one don't miss the fawning phone calls, ""long time listener, first time caller, adore you Diane"". I do wish they would podcast all the shows though.",5
Do,05/26/2017,Booploopscrochet,Better,1
New Favorite Podcast,05/28/2017,Illinois Listener,"Insightful, balanced, timely analysis /review of news and politics",5
Thoughtful and Informative,05/28/2017,Bien Dormi,Love this show! Joshua does an excellent job of selecting knowledgeable guests and letting them discuss well considered questions. Diverse themes and guests make this particularly informative. Just wish it was the whole show.,5
Great show- need full 2 hours on podcast,05/28/2017,Alsos-cakesandmore,I love listening to the show live but sometimes get pulled away. I shouldn't have to go to 2 places to listen to the full show. We get 1/2 the show on podcast than have to go to the 1A web for the rest. When that happens I just listen to both shows on there. The full Friday show is available now on podcast- why not make them all? Once it's changed I'll definitely rate it 5 stars.,3
Joshua Johnson for 2020,06/01/2017,BootyJamz5555555555,"I could not ask for a better replacement for Diane Rehm's spot for the Round-up. His wit is unmatched, and he exudes intelligence. The candor he posses, and that fearless drive to get to the facts, makes my drive from place to place such a pleasure.",5
Whole show please!,06/01/2017,hman01,A segment from the second hour came on when I had to get out of the car. Thought I would listen to it later but it ain't here😡!,1
Fantastic!,06/01/2017,Pajaroyoso,"I love this podcast! Joshua (the host) does a wonderful job asking questions and moderating, the issues are great, and they do a good job trying to present different perspectives from their guests.",5
Sane and civil,06/02/2017,haubie,"A worthy successor to Diane Rehm. Joshua Johnson is wonderful, as is his occasional substitute, Indira Lakshmanan.",5
A weekly destination,06/04/2017,Nurse Keith,"As a professional podcaster, I can say without reservations that The 1A has become a go-to source of inspiration and thought-provoking conversation. I'm hooked.",5
Hubrissima,06/05/2017,Hubrissima,"The 1A has become better and better since January. Topics are timely and serious; there is a clear effort at providing a balance between various points of view. Occasionally Joshua Johnson becomes overly insistent, but in general, he and his discussants are respectful of those with opposing stances. There are no rants, no ad hominem comments. Many of Johnson's knowledgeable guests regularly appeared on the Diane Rehm show. Podcast downloading is cumbersome, however, and episodes tend not to appear promptly. Many thanks to NPR for providing a fine, informative program.",4
Great informative Podcast,03/14/2017,Helenared,"I wasn't sure what to expect when this podcast started, but you won me over. I like Joshua Johnson a lot, he's fair, kind and knowledgeable, and has done a great job bringing up relevant and interesting topics of discussion. Keep up the good work!",5
Incomplete!,03/14/2017,LSS3,"I suppose there is some value in editing out content that is irrelevant in a podcast. It would have been nice if Diane's show had removed the break music, for example. But 1A is simply not posting both hours except for, thankfully, the Friday News Roundup. This is just not acceptable. They say they are working on posting more content. What's the problem? Diane's show was fully posted for years! It seems like they are withholding content in order to push listeners to their app. No thanks! I have lots of podcasts to listen to from a variety of sources. Don't silo me with your app!",1
"Solid, but needs to grow.",03/14/2017,Butterydeer,"Please publish full content. I love 1a (clever), but please start pushing out the entire show. I'm giving 5 stars based on it's full potential.",5
Could be better,03/15/2017,Sprinklejuice,"I like the variety of topics covered, but the host has a habit of ""clarifying"" the comments of people he disagrees with. I don't mind hosts taking guests to task, in fact I prefer it, but he's transparently one-sided.",3
Show never took off,03/18/2017,Seattle_ex,Out of respect for the DR show I stuck with this show for over 2 months. But I just can't do it anymore. It has never found its stride and doesn't have a rhythm.,1
The Friday Newsroundup is still OK.,03/20/2017,Dhmon,"The topics are pretty outlandish. The Be prePARed show was the worst thing I've ever heard on NPR, made me sick to my stomach to think about it-what a waste of time!",3
Insightful yet accessible policy analysis,04/07/2017,Shame eater,Great discussions on a variety of topics,5
"Great, well rounded podcast",04/07/2017,Rolquan,5 stars!,5
1A comments,04/07/2017,Baker43,"One thing I am noticing is ""advertising creep"". I have drawn a ""red line""--if there are 5 more seconds of advertising, I'm out! I don't want to know about other podcasts, Fairfax, VA, etc. While exercising and listening to 1A, it is not convenient to fast forward through the advertisements. Keep them out. I contribute to NPR every year! If advertising increases, I'll go back to listening to my music over which I have total control!",4
Dianne Rhem's Legacy lives on.,04/09/2017,MBKircus,Still informative and gives a platform for civil dialog.,5
It's okay,04/13/2017,TheWarder500,Not as good as DR show. But there are good shows and bad. I think by setting this up as the replacment set the bar to high. Should have completly seperated the 2 shows becasue you cant replace DR shes one of a kind.,3
⭐️🌟⭐️🌟⭐️,04/15/2017,Blacdymond,It deserves 5 stars. I love that new episodes drop daily. Very informative on a multitude of subjects... Monday can't come soon enough,5
We still can't get it all,04/17/2017,jfh24,"Good show, but I still can't understand why we can't have both shows podcast. I generally listen while driving, jogging, or other activity. Podcasts work, but going to a website doesn't. If Diane Rehm could do it, I see no reason why it can't be maintained. Until that happens, since I'm only getting half of the show, I'll give it half of my rating.",2
Thank you!!!,04/18/2017,Drogtown,"I love it. I'll always miss not having Diane but this series is an excellent replacement. Smart, informative, and covering a wide array of topics. And the title is perfect! Keep up the good work.",5
One star until both hours are up,04/21/2017,Shuh'nyeah,C'mon put up both hours on itunes.,1
This is great,04/24/2017,eelplace,"A fabulous podcast, educational for everyone.",5
A thoughtful podcast.,04/26/2017,Midnight Towboy,"This podcast does really do a lot with the 30-40 minutes it normally has to really give you an idea about the topic they talk about. The only problem I can see with this podcast is that the vague overarching theme means they can do pretty much anything, which can be hard to follow at times.",5
Great topics covered,04/28/2017,Figure HDTV,"I really enjoyed the bride diversity of topics covered here. Sometimes the discussion may be a little one sided, but it is very informative overall. I enjoy the Friday news Roundup the best. They cover many of the big stories from the week all in one episode. They look at both domestically and internationally.",4
NPR great as usual,05/03/2017,Tofutulip,It would be even better if the whole show was available,5
Joshua Johnson does not push back enough on suspect statements,05/04/2017,Concecao,"I listened to the Diane Rheam show for decades. I was hopeful, but am now disappointed by the replacement show 1A. I am a woman of color and was excited to hear a potentially multicultural viewpoint on a national news show. I've found Mr. Johnson to be gullible in that he allows utter falsehoods to go unchecked on the air. For example, on a news roundup early in the Trump presidency, a reporter guest said that Trump was focusing his deportations on ""bad hombres,"" when there was already clear evidence all over the news that non-criminal immigrant workers and parents were being deported. Mr. Johnson let that falsehood stand unchecked.",1
I enjoy this show,02/06/2017,Whovian twag,"It seems this show is just finding its footing, but it is a good listen.",4
incomplete,02/07/2017,eimiro,confused about the international hour of the friday news round up. where can I get it?,2
Disappointed,02/09/2017,kathyssssssss,"I listened to Diane Rehm since 1985 I miss her format. My complaint is that they only post 1 hour of the show on I tunes. At first it was the first hour and now it's the second hour, the ""light"" hour. I've written to the show and received a spin type of answer as to why there's only one hour on I tunes. I can't listen to the show live so I depend on the podcasts. I am getting use to his style and I do understand that live callers ""waste time"" with their complements, too bad it's all the bottom line now. One more point, I don't understand why on Fridays they don't post both hours of the politic hour. Doesn't management understand the power Diane had in DC. As I can't listen to the politics hour anymore, it becomes very easy to stop listening all together. I still have faith that they are in a learning period right now and will change.",3
All over the place,02/10/2017,Staffski,It was hard for me to get in to this podcast. There was no consistent story. I didn't like the interview style of all of the podcasts; the guests mostly gave the answers I'd expect and there was no analysis or pushing on the guest views. I'm sticking to NPR politics and NYTimes daily news podcasts,2
Lighten up.,02/13/2017,LosinIt,"A bit calm and passive for my taste. It's NPR politics, for serious grown ups.",3
Great show,02/16/2017,NatchOR,Timely and entertaining - thought-provoking guests that present new ideas & reintroduce old ones in interesting ways.,5
Incomplete Podcast,02/17/2017,FlyingPJib,I agree with most reviewers-why don't the podcasts contain the full show? What is wrong with the portions of the show that are not included? It always seems the portion I want to hear is excluded. Why? NPR needs to respond to this major concern.,1
I was worried....,02/17/2017,Wellfleetgal,"that no one would ever be able to fill Diane Rehm's slot...but this is an excellent, thoughtful, calm, reasoned, intelligent discussion of current events (domestic and international) and trends. I am pleased it does not accept on-air calls that more often than not waste time with pleasantries or caller issues. The host is very reasoned and articulate and solicits responses/comments from a good variety of knowledgeable guests. I like it a lot. Different style than our beloved Diane, but it is not meant to be a replica of her show.",5
Unbalanced treatment of Israel,02/17/2017,Firstluis,"The show on February 17 (second hour) was unbalanced in its treatment of Israel. It was stated repeatedly that Israel plans to build ""thousands of new settlements"". Joshua himself said ""more than five-thousand new settlements"". That is not correct. The announced plan is to build thousands of new homes. A home does not make a settlement. Please correct the error.",2
Great Show,02/18/2017,ThaKidd17,Very informative,5
well done,02/20/2017,DesertSlug,"replacing diane rehm is a VERY hard act to follow. i think joshua johnson is doing a good job of keeping important aspects of diane's show (Friday news roundup) while taking the topics and format in some refreshing new directions. i especially like that he does not take phone calls - that was the worse part of the diane rehm show. taking questions off the air for the guests is a nice balance. i want to hear what the guests have to say, not what the usually uninformed public has to say.",5
Excellent interviews and conversation,02/20/2017,Matt Mauve,"In depth conversation with hosts of various political stripes, including foreign dignitaries. Very informative and worth a listen.",5
Great podcast,02/21/2017,Morgs202,One of my favorite podcasts right now. Feeling informed and entertained!,5
Host is rude and jarring,02/24/2017,Tiffyyyyyyyyyyyy,"While I love the content and theme of 1A, Joshua Johnson was extremely rude and almost berates the speakers brought on the show. Yes, sometimes they speak on a tangent and the host tries to bring it back on topic, but it does not need to be done so crudely. It made the entire show unenjoyable to listen to",1
Excellent journalism,02/25/2017,RBM_III,"Great topics, balanced discussion",5
Sad excuse for DR's replacement,02/28/2017,666SDK666,"If you are a white, cisgendered, heteronormative male and feel the need to be whiteshamed, manshamed and basically blamed for everything, this show is for you. Or, I suppose if you are none of the above but need someone to blame for your own failures, here it is. Otherwise, skip it.",1
Great Discussion. Not enough Content.,02/28/2017,Kingmob2323,"I don't get is why the show is released the way it is. It's a two hour radio show that covers more than one interesting topic, but we only get this weird, chopped up version that feels overly curated.",1
Neat,03/01/2017,Jabbasias,"Apparently there is a 2 hour version of the show, I'd like to hear that one. Anyway, the show is great the topics covered are interesting.",5
Great work,03/03/2017,Poor spender,"Overall I think the discussions are insightful, and the topics are highly important.",4
Love the Show and Joshua!,03/07/2017,BarbaraThingsNow,"Wow! I have listened to Diane for years and truly loved what she did. As such, I could not imagine anyone in her 2 hour slot. And while the show is shorter, after listening to Joshua, I am truly pleased at him as the choice. He asks awesome questions and is truly an informed host. I cannot understand the negative reviews, but for my part I am quite impressed. Keep up the great work Joshua!",5
Pleased with what I've heard,01/24/2017,Jninewhat,"This is a great start and this program has so much potential for growth. I do hope that people give it a chance and aren't just looking for someone to be just like DR, as she is truly one of a kind and really cannot be replaced. Mr. Johnson has thus far done an excellent job, the topics have been interesting, informative and educational. I look forward to much more.",5
Biased,01/24/2017,Tonyquick,"This podcast is not trying to have a meaningful discussion. It is a very biased talk show, which assumes only liberal ideology is correct.",1
Missing pieces?,01/25/2017,Bvertrees,I really love the show but would be much better if you posted the whole thing.,3
"Informative, Interesting, Relevant!!!",01/26/2017,Malakaris,"I am loving this show; Joshua does a great job, love his questions. Great Job! Keep it up! Btw thank you!",5
Superb!,01/26/2017,Orlochann,"Joshua is a great host, who maintains civility and ensures the topic at hand is thoroughly explained, understood & debated. 1A addresses the most important news stories in these very troubling and rapidly changing times.

"Great show, BUT bad feed!",01/27/2017,NoisyAstro,"I am really enjoying this new show and the host Joshua Johnson. I am, however, extremely disappointed that only half of the radio show ends up in the podcast feed. What gives?! We can't all listen live or go to the website. These feeds are great for keeping up during a busy work week so please please PLEASE release the whole thing on the feed.",3
Too easy on Trump,01/28/2017,David_Loves_Travel,Shocked at how low key the guests were on the Friday news roundup after trump's first week. Had to stop listening. Things are falling apart and the podcast is acting like things are normal.,3
Worth a daily listen,01/28/2017,Bd1o1,"I've listened to each podcast since the first one. It's part of my daily news/media diet. I really enjoy the in-depth discussions. I also LOVE the fact that the podcast is only part of the broadcast. 35-45 minutes a day is manageable. I don't have time to take in the full two hours, and I know where to go if I want to hear other parts of the broadcast. Host Joshua Johnson is great.",5
Disappointed,01/28/2017,Jgbutlerliketolearn,"I am disappointed with this show. It is not engaging. The discussions do not go into the same depth as The Diane Rehm Show, which was amazing. I miss The Diane Rehm show.",1
Definitely recommend,01/28/2017,LovetoRun123456,"I like the variety of topics. If one doesn't speak to me, I skip it and listen to the next. Interesting to listen to an in-depth conversation from a variety of view points on topics ranging from political news to creativity. Not quite Diane, but will get there. Thank you, Joshua!",5
Partial show gets partial stars,01/29/2017,jmb030,I feel like we only get 1/5 of the show so here's 1/5 of the potential stars. Pretty big letdown to go from Diane Rehm to getting the crumbs of this program. Can't listen live so I rely on the podcast. Please post the full episodes. Both hours. All of it.,1
Making Meaning: The way I want to listen to news.,01/31/2017,Txairo,"Much of the news and media easily available is given in bite-size chunks. But much like snacking all day can result in a poor diet if good choices aren't consciously made, it can be incredibly unsatisfying and unhealthy to snack on information tid-bits throughout the day without undestanding the meat and meaning of an issue. 1A is the incredibly satisfying dinner I want to sit down to every evening.",5
Waste of valuable time slot,01/31/2017,hed1117,"At a time when the fundamental freedoms of our democracy are UNQUESTIONABLY under assault, the format and content of your show is superficial and anodyne.",1
New Favorite,01/31/2017,Jkriegs,I try and catch this everyday. Great host and content.,5
Very good,02/01/2017,jazzmanta,"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews. It's seems that many reviewers are rating it for what it is not, not what it is. I think Joshua does an excellent job, the guests are insightflul, and the tops are timely and pertinent.",5
Informative and Welcoming,02/03/2017,Kq338,"I enjoy the wide range of topics that change with each episode. Also enjoy when there are guests representing two sides of the same issue. Joshua Johnson is a good moderator for topics, and seems to be well-informed on much of the content.",5
Great Show,02/03/2017,threadgood,Great show! Keep up the good work.,5
"Informative, objective",02/04/2017,MEG411,"I find this show informative and objective that covers a range of topics. Some I'm not interested in, most I am. I appreciate the coverage provided of listeners and their feedback, particularly as Joshua picks a variety of viewpoints to present. I see from the reviews that it's not the full show? As I'm overseas, I would never have known otherwise.",5
Wonderful,02/04/2017,KSSY5437,Diane Rehm made a great choice in her replacement. Joshua is fabulous and absolutely fills the void I expected Diane's departure to leave. Recommended to all.,5
Perfect follow up,02/04/2017,DrFishinWA,Joshua couldn't be better to follow in Diane Rehm's footstep. I agree that more content with be better and I'm flexible. I can stream the internet! Keep up the great work!,5
Joshua Johnson is superb,01/16/2017,Starfaced5,"Joshua Johnson is a terrific broadcaster. Love his voice, energized and interested in his subject, pleasure to hear his voice. This is going to be great....excellent choice for replacement to DR's show.",5

Please include the entire show in the podcast,01/16/2017,FamilyinNewEngland,"Some of the shows have been great, particularly the news round-up. I would really like the entire show to be available on the podcast. I would like to see a broader range of topics with experts weighing in - science topics, interviews, etc. I realize this is a new show and not meant to be a version of the Diane Rehm show but I think there were many wonderful elements of the Diane Rehm show that could be incorporated into 1A.",3
Good podcast,01/16/2017,Sunnycreek,I've only listened to a few shows so far but I've really enjoyed them. Will be a regular,4
Fine.,01/16/2017,Word.to.your.mother,"I think this podcast has potential. It is too long and rambling right now. I think there needs to be more structure, and better material.",4
Interesting but incomplete,01/16/2017,Lissadal,"I love the show so far, but I would like to hear the whole thing!",4
Smug and unaware of its own faults.,01/17/2017,Ymeiner,"Post trump elections, you would think that NPR news would at least take a stab at reflecting on the need of opinionated news but no, instead, they added a podcast that is responsible to sentences such as (not a direct quote) 'you can't call it fake news because if it's fake it's not news' - which If I was Aaron Sorkin, this is how I would start the movie about the death of news.",2
Whole Show,01/17/2017,Tinychispas,I suscribed and Good show but after reading the other reviews I checked and it is a bit short. Lack of commercials maybe? Anyway keep them coming!,5
I miss Diane Rehm,01/17/2017,🤑😜🤑😜🤑😝,"The conversation isnt as dynamic as it was with Diane at the helm. Seems like a lot of glossing over, and multiple guests with identical opinions. I miss the debates and tough (but polite) questioning that were hallmarks of Diane's show. The pre-recorded listener snippets are filler, and not called in to question (regardless of how contrary to the 1st amendment they may be-- today a caller said protesters should not be allowed to go to the inauguration,and neither the host nor the panel said a thing!).",1
Need to publish full episodes,01/17/2017,JP198984,Many listeners cannot tune into the live radio broadcast. Broadcasting only a portion of the program through podcast will likely lose listeners.,3
Whole show please,01/18/2017,jessd687,I am a huge fan of this show so far. It inspires interesting conversation and makes my commute to and from class more interesting. However-my only access to the show is through the podcast and I feel that the show is losing its impact and spark by being posted only partially. Give us the whole show!,4
Incomplete,01/19/2017,PennyLane78913,"Though I enjoy the show and have been binging on it ever since I heard about it on another NPR podcast, it seems so incomplete. The entire episodes on the site are thought provoking and wonderful, but this shortened version doesn't cover up the fact that it's a shorter version of something bigger. You can tell things have been cut and you're left feeling left out of parts of the convo. 5 stars for the show. 3 stars for the amount of the show we get.",3
I wanted to love this show but.....,01/19/2017,Fan of Diane,"I cried during Diane Rehm's final episodes but believed her time slot would be filled with an amazing show. I also vowed not to compare 1A with Diane. I have listened to every episode since the debut and I have given up. 1a does not hold my attention and the guests are not as animated or engaged, as I hoped they would be. Also, the episode topics are not very compelling. I understand that the premise is to elaborate on issues that most people are unaware of. I unsubscribed from 1A today but will listen to the Friday news roundup. This show just isn't for me",2
Release the full show,01/19/2017,DrBarnaby,"Pretty good start, but not releasing the full show for the podcast is very frustrating.",2
Good show; bad podcast management,01/19/2017,senor_dan,"I think this show has the potential to truly fill the enormous gap left by Diane Rehm, but they need to figure out their podcast system, and fast! They risk losing the listeners they have if not. Listen, Diane Rehm's formula for two shows & two podcasts per day was not broken, so why try to fix it?!?",3
I'm not super impressed YET,01/19/2017,Teal_fawkes,"I am very intrigued by this premise, and I hope it bears out as promised! That said...I'm allowing for a growth and development curve right now.",3
Diverse experiences,01/20/2017,Dan from Pittsburgh,"I really enjoy the show and the podcast. Since I've been listening I've heard from ambassadors, voters, and local activists supporting all sorts of different causes. Because of that, I gain exposure to opinions and discussions which are thoughtful and rich (and outside of my personal bubble). Joshua is a very good host and seems to have a broad interest in news topics. The show also has a quicker pace than its predecessor but doesn't come across as disjointed or partial. Keep up the good work.",4
Millennial review,01/20/2017,EliJGay,Happy for the length of the show for a daily podcast. Informative and to the point.,5
Monday after the March,01/23/2017,KateElizabethHamilton,"Seeking action the Monday after the March, I found information, skepticism and hope in 1A.",5
What about NPR One?,01/23/2017,gennypow,"Excellent, but feels incomplete (because it is incomplete).

Suggestion: leave the abridged version for third party podcast providers like stitcher, iTunes, etc., and allow access to the complete broadcast on NPR One as an incentive to download the app.",3
Excellent,01/12/2017,Entropy123,Thoughtful discussion about American politics and world events. I hope they soon put the entire 2hr show out as a podcast. I would certainly like to listen to more of this wonderful show.,5
Hmmm....,01/13/2017,Robert Jacobson,"The successor to The Diane Rehm Show, 1A suffers within the same mainstream press, DC-centric echo-chamber. NPR's weekly On The Media has a long history of excellently dealing with First Amendment and other communication issues critically, incisively, and entertainingly. It already holds the high ground. I don't see the need for a daily competitor that's thinner and less well-focused.",3
"A great start, can't wait to hear more.",01/13/2017,nzahn1,"I really have enjoyed listening to this podcast so far, I hope they continue to improve and bring a wider range of guests.",5
Excellent replacement,01/13/2017,Dedrey,Replacing the Diane Rehm show is hugely difficult to do but 1A seems to be doing a wonderful job. The discussions are thoughtful and substantive.,5
what is this?,01/13/2017,deeddoe,"agree with other reviewers, what happened to the 2 hrs?",1
Going places,01/13/2017,Cactusjul,Joshua is doing a great job.,4
Astickastone,01/13/2017,astickastone,"A bit early to compare him to Diane Rehm, but I really like this show and will continue to listen in.",4
Podcasts do not do justice to the 1A,01/13/2017,Masami Kojima,"After realizing that even podcasts are abridged, I began listening to the full show on my smart phone, although it is very inconvenient for me to do so. I have listened to every show, and am very impressed and pleased. I find it as thoughtful as the Diane Rehm Show. I have found every show to cover topics that are interesting to me and relevant; I did not listen to every Diane Rehm show. Among the lesser-known ones, I particularly appreciated ""Order In The Classroom: From Hall Monitors To Handcuffs"" and ""What Works In The Fight Against Homelessness?"" If only WAMU would post every show and the entire show, that will make many listeners very happy.",5
Joshua Johnson is a great interviewer,01/13/2017,Bentivolio,Joshua Johnson is a terrific host - been listening to him since he was on KQED. Everyone should listen to him!,5
Un-Insightful,01/14/2017,Numbers113,"Irrelevant, un-insightful, liberal waste of time. One star because they tried.",2
This is the podcast I've been waiting for!,01/14/2017,zhwilkins,"This podcast, while still new and thus finding it's style, is doing exactly what needs to be done.",5
Entirety,01/14/2017,séamuis,"Great show so far, and can be an excellent, competent replacement for the DR show. While I understand that 1A, like the DR show is fundamentally a DC based radio program, your larger audience is and will continue to be podcast listeners. Without them, your show won't have much success in broad terms. In order to not risk losing those listeners, you need to offer whole programs on the podcast feed. This especially includes both the domestic AND International hours of the Friday news roundup. It's completely essential. Without this you will lose listeners, and there is no logical reason not to offer this. National listeners aren't going to be willing to listen partially through their podcast app and partially from the 1A website, just to get the whole programs. The show is excellent so far, but give your listeners the shows in their entirety, everyday. It how we want to listen and consume.",3
One of the best news podcasts availible,01/14/2017,dukefan2012,"While still in transition from the Diane Rheme show, 1A is proving to be a great source for indepth analysis of current events. No shouting, no propeganda, no political grandstanding by political plants, no overt attempt to sway your opinion. Just civil conversation and thoughtful analysis. Currently the podcast isn't delivering the full radio show, but this will change shortly we are told from the host. Please give this show a chance. No matter what your political or religious leanings, this show will deliver. Good reporting like this matters!",5
A great distillation,01/14/2017,yorkville2003,"I really love this podcast and how much I learn in such a short amount of time. I know many reviews are calling for the entire show to be in the podcast but for me I feel that it is an excellent distillation of the most important aspects of the show. On the other hand, I would surely love the entire show as well. Thank you 1A for this timely and well done show.",5
NPR has not responded to whole show requests.,01/14/2017,jazzrob,"Although no one can replace Diane Rehm, Joshua Johnson is a very smart and enthusiastic interviewer with a lot of potential. However, not posting the entire shows not only doesn’t make sense but will destroy the show. I’ve listened to Diane Rehm mostly through the podcast as have many others. So far NPR and WAMU have given no response in word or action to the unanimous requests of its listeners for the full podcasts. What the heck is wrong with this picture, and why doesn’t anyone respond?",4
Great conversations,01/15/2017,Talimander,"Enjoy listening to Joshua Jackson and guests tackle the topics of the day. Would love to hear more of the show, but to be honest, I don't know that I'd have time to listen longer. It's hard enough to carve out 30 minutes. But I'm happy to do so for this show!",5
"Great content, interesting guests",01/15/2017,Week-long listener,"The truncated episodes feel a bit like a daily briefing, easy to get a jump start on the news in the morning.",5
Love it!,01/15/2017,DShouse5,"Great show. Am enjoying it very much...it has quickly become a ""can't miss"" podcast for me",5
5 stars,01/15/2017,moniqueavelaine,I love this podcast! More critical and current analysis. Great guests.,5
Be better,01/15/2017,youthanon,"While the show's topics are interesting and relevant, and the host is winsome, 1A is plagued by bias. A more even handed approach to the day's topics would be appreciated. For instance, 1A's coverage and commentator comments on Buzzfeed's (and subsequently CNN's) fake news fiasco was, for all the hubbub involving ""fake news"" these days, a joke. Don't throw softballs just because you may like or agree with a source/outlet/politician, generally. Be upright, be honest, and be just--otherwise you're only contributing to the noise.",1
Do the whole show,01/08/2017,Kalebbn,You should put the whole show on the podcast.,3
Missing podcasts,01/08/2017,D.C. 00000105,Does not provide podcasts for each show. Frustrating and no explanation why.,2

Love it! Wish it was a little bit longer,01/08/2017,Yeah_carl,"I'm loving the conversations. The producers are doing a great job bringing in rational voices that I don't always agree with, but give me something new to think about.",4
Not that thoughout,01/09/2017,1A Review,"The show touts Amendment 1, but only tolerates free speech they agree with, which by definition is not free, what the show is about. NPR as usual very friendly to the left, but if you want a show that will use basic logic then stay away from NPR",2
Very enjoyable,01/09/2017,Daniellezzzzzz,Great and insightful conversations,5
Great start,01/10/2017,Scherzo411,"I'm thrilled about the show so far. Totally hooked. Even Diane's show had no specific theme from day to day (except for Friday's), so I'm unclear about this criticism. I agree that the entire show should be uploaded. Looking forward to more of the show.",5
While show?,01/10/2017,Concerned NPR donater,"I donate and support NPR, but can't get this show in full in podcast form?

A poor replacement for Diane, you feel like you are being lectured at and not a part of it all.",1
Fantastic host,01/10/2017,buyoriginal,I have been very pleased with the direction of the new show! The way you direct the conversation is very skillful and does a good job to hit on the other sides of an argument. Playing devils advocate really helps keep the shows balanced. I also love that you filter your audience questions by having them leave a message rather than the live calls (those can often derail or get off subject). Great job so far!,5
Rev,01/10/2017,deaconchris,Would like to hear the whole show on podcast. Sometimes I have to miss live show or segments,4
Lies,01/10/2017,SaneProgressive,If you want lies brewed for the purpose of forwarding the oligarchs agenda of war and profit you've come to the right place. It's a shame where NPR is nowadays. Could only make it five min in of the Friday roundup before I couldn't stand the outrageous lies.,1
provide episodes in their entirety,01/10/2017,Jason Brownlee,"I'm looking to hear entire podcasts of episodes as broadcast, including the international news roundup. Until that basic format comes back, I'll be at best an infrequent listener.",1
This just in...,01/10/2017,TommieT,"Im new to 1A, and although I've only listed to one episode (ACA), I found the discussion insightful, professional, and balanced. I look forward to listening to future episodes.",5
Why are people paying you to lie to them?,01/10/2017,DestroyerofFakeNews,"This is a state funded piece of political garbage. If anyone is looking for anything that is informative, genuine and not engorged in blatant lies this isn't your program. Inappropriate journalism is becoming a poison in this country and NPR is only adding to the toxic climate of true fake news.",1
I like it,01/10/2017,ashmcr16,"So far, I'm enjoying listening to 1A. I like the conversations and I like that it's not just screaming into the void; they want to hear what people have to say & want to improve. I like the topics and will continue to listen.",4

"Great, but give us the whole show!",01/11/2017,Бобчинский,"Joshua Johnson is great, and so are his guests. But as other reviewers have noted, this podcast would be better if we got the whole show.",5
Whole show?,01/11/2017,Sassyfrenchpants,I've been enjoying listening to the show and trying to stay informed without the DRshow. I've been wondering why the podcast doesn't seem to include the whole broadcast show? Is this something that can be changed?,3
Hopeful,01/11/2017,School yogi,I am liking the start of this podcast but I work full time in a school and will never be able to listen live just like I didn't to Diane Rehm but I did always listen to her shows on the podcast. I am really missing the whole show. Please post it all!,4
Very enjoyable listening,01/06/2017,KBGunny,"In my opinion, Mr. Johnson's style and presentation are very good! The courtesy and civility of the program are wonderful. I find the topical currency, the guests and the tenor of the program to demonstrate excellence. I hope this program/podcast are long lived.",5
A fresh and terrific news podcast,01/06/2017,Shane Guiter,"I am loving this radio show and the podcast as well. I think it is really great that the show is crafted into a podcast that captures the essence of the show, but is great as a podcast. It's the best of both worlds. Joshua is a great host, and I'm looking forward to seeing where the show goes as it matures. Also, I love how he is constantly asking the audience for feedback and ideas. It makes me feel like I am a part of the podcast.",5
Great Job!,01/06/2017,BCAlex,I was dismayed to see you disappear from KQED and am so glad to have found you in this tremendous program! I'm looking forward to hearing you every day. I wish the podcast included both complete hours each day!,5

Mr,01/07/2017,Trixter9,Great start. Love everything I've heard. Really liked that keeping the Fri News Round Ups. Hope the international hour is included.,5
Incomplete because too much audio cut,01/07/2017,jjam103,I've relied on the Diane Rhem show for years as a source of in depth discussion and analysis of issues. I would listen to 4-8 hours per week in podcast format. This type of is now more important than ever. It is extremely disappointing that the decision has been made to only air 1/4 of the new show. I would kindly request that WAMU release both hours in full as Diane did.,1
disappointed,01/07/2017,jmbg57,"I can't get the actual 1A broadcast on my local station, so I rely on podcasts. What I've heard, I like. Problem is, we are only getting a small portion of theh show. What's up with that? No explanation on the website or in the podcast. I'll give it a bit more time before tuning out altogether, but am disappointed so far.",3
Make all episodes available as podcasts,01/07/2017,akh157,"This is a great program, but why aren't all of the episodes available as podcasts? Diane Rehm made all of her episodes available. For those who can't listen to the show live, podcasts are the easiest way to catch up with the program. The episodes are available on the 1A website, so why not here? Joshua, please add all of the episodes to itunes!!",3
Good start,01/07/2017,SingeVert,"Off to a good start. This format is not breaking any new ground, of course. But Mr Johnson is smart, personable, and capable and is showing a steady hand at the tiller. Don't be afraid to inject some edgier voices and ideas--Diane Rheem show was too staid and genteel.",4
"Broadcast is great, podcast not so much",01/07/2017,GatorGirlLiz,"Why can't they give us the whole broadcast in podcast form? Instead, we get an edited, much-shortened version of only one of the two daily topics. We can't even get both hours of Friday's news round up as podcasts. The whole broadcast is available to stream from WAMU's website, but that's not exactly helpful for those of us who rely on podcast downloads to see us through daily commutes, errands, and dog walking!",2
REALLY Fair & Balanced,01/07/2017,Strid8,"Thank you for such an engaging and intelligent podcast. Each episode has been very compelling and thought provoking. I wish we could get the entire episode in my podcast feed, but that's my only complaint.",5
Friday News Round-Up,01/07/2017,bowfin,My member station doesn't carry 1A so it is a shame that both hours of the Friday show wasn't shared. Granted I can go to the website but that is more complicated if you are on the road. As a result I am less likely to listen.,3
Fantastic!,01/07/2017,MrMarkCK,My fav!,5
Great start with big shoes to fill.,01/07/2017,J-SGN,"I have enjoyed the first week, and I typically listen on the old NPR news app. I'd love it if in all digital releases you'd feature the folder duration of both hours.",5

"Loved ""America first"" discussion",01/04/2017,Ebartles,"Fabulous discussion of the moral dilemma of humanitarian intervention and what should be done about atrocities which are committed outside of our borders, but that are committed against families and individuals just like ourselves. High quality and well informed guest speakers, and good balance of accessible discourse with some IR jargon for the political nerds out there. Excited for the next one!",5
Disappointed,01/05/2017,OolieJ,"I think a show on NPR which claims its focus is the First Amendment would actually care about accuracy... in the opening sound bites, there is a mention of a right to speedy trial which is not 1A. It seems like there's too much production and gimmicks rather than substance. It makes me painfully long for a show with a passion for being informed, interesting and civil without all sorts of tricks.",2
Not All Shows Here,01/05/2017,E.T.Believes,"I listened to a portion of the shows on the radio but could not hear all of it due to time. i went to this poscast and I found that all of the shows for the dates shown are not here. On the radio 1A is a 2 hour block but here there are only 30 minute segments. Also the show I listened to is not even listed. What gives? On the radio show they tell you to listen to the podcast, yet that show is not even here. Needs more work!",2
Boom.,01/05/2017,jillaaa,"This poli-pod couldn't have arrived at a better time. I've never been so afraid that our country is wandering away from it's foundational constitution. These hosts do a great job of toning down the importance of party, and presenting a concise, straightforward, digestible argument on behalf of our rights. Can't wait for more episodes.",5
Need full length show!!!,01/05/2017,Crasher Space Fan,"Great content, but please make the full length show available as a podcast as the DR show did.",5
A Great New Show!,01/05/2017,GigiANash,I have been a fan of The Diane Rehm Show for many years and was concerned about any successor. Though there were a few bumps in the show I just heard still loved the refreshing intelligent conversation. Diane would be proud. Please continue to offer thought provoking dialogue. The new generation so needs it!,5
Where's the rest of the show?,01/05/2017,ORDER S1XTY S1X,"Much like the Diane Rehm Show before it, I cannot listen to 1A live. I depend on the availability of podcasts to hear it. Sadly, only about a quarter of the actual show is available on podcast. DR's show was always available in its entirety and I think most of us expected it'd be the same with 1A. *HUGE* disappointment. I hate to do a one-star rating, as the *content* of the show is pretty good so far, but I feel this rating is reflective of the podcast itself... 30 minutes out of a two hour production. Not cool.",1
"You can do better than this, NPR!",01/05/2017,Prubz,"It's honestly ridiculous that the full episodes are not posted on iTunes - or even the NPR One app.

The whole show?,01/05/2017,ex-washingtonian,"Out of a profound respect for Diane Rehm and all she did for all of us, I will gladly give this replacement show a listen....when the show staff respects the listeners enough to provide the entire show.",1
New Favorite,01/06/2017,ListenerKathryn,I am sold on 1A. It improves on the usual political podcast: guests are people with expertise and strong points of view rather than the typical pundits and political reporters.,5
Please post full show!,01/06/2017,Ghost of Perdition,"Please post the full show! Some of us can't listen at the time it goes live, and having to go to the website is inconvenient as I listen slot while I'm deriving. I'm giving this four stars because Joshua Johnson seems intelligent, kind, and what I've heard sounds good, but full episodes need to be posted if the show is going to live up to the high standards of the DR show.",4
Technologically challenged,01/06/2017,RobertoStorio,"I guess NPR is only interested in attracting the audience that can listen to live radio at 10 in the morning! The app only gives 30 minutes of the show and 1A doesn't even appear on the NPR1 app. From the 30 minutes, which is on the app the show appears very good, but I'm really not interested in NPR choosing which quarter of this show I should listen to every day. Either NPR is telling us they really don't care about this show or the show was just not ready for prime time on the technical side. Frustrating for those of us who would like to give this show a chance. Regretfully, after years of listening to Diane Rehm and now hoping to listen to this new show, I will tune out.",1
Just the right show...,01/06/2017,Okeechobeing,... at just the right time with just the right voice in just the right city.,5

Wonderful and refreshing;,01/03/2017,Pair reviewer,"This is such a great educational podcast. In today's discourse, the upcoming inauguration and through processing the recent election, it's a perfect dose of reality and reminder of the greatness of our country and our democracy.",5
Why not publish the full show?,01/03/2017,silversonic547,"We had the full broadcast available for the Diane Rehm podcast. Not having the same for 1A is a huge regression, no matter how good Joshua Johnson's show is.",1

My one suggestion and plea is to echo what others have said- please make each hour of the daily 2 hour show available in podcast apps like in its entirely, the way Diane's show is. I think I and others want to hear the whole show even though we don't live in WAMU's listening range, and I'm worried 1A might lose potential listeners who tune in now, encounter this problem in podcast apps, and don't return. Other than that, best of luck, and a warm welcome! Keep going! :)",4
