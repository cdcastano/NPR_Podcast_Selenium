Editing needs some work; overall short and sweet,04/03/2019,Nikolai Shkurkin,"Often the beginning and ends of the podcast are garbled, cut-off, or oddly made. I listen to NPR on the radio sometimes and hear the same reports and they sound fine. It should be easy to fix for an otherwise polished set of NPR podcasts.",4

Hard News Only; Fast and To-the-Point,11/01/2018,Jack_McCoy,"I don‚Äôt care what your politics are; NPR has probably the best 5 minute hourly news update around. This is the same constantly updated newscast you can get on the NPR app, and they also post it on Twitter on the NPR News Now account.

Sound mixing is odd,01/29/2018,ionw,"There is an odd tinny modulation to the mixing of the sound of this podcast. I hear it on headphones or my car stereo. I listen to the NPR app often, and it does not have the same odd quality.",3
Only podcast having trouble playing properly.,02/23/2018,reviews-matter,Every update isn‚Äôt playing the audio file smoothly. The audio stops entirely and starts again in a later spot. I don‚Äôt understand why this would be the only podcast show that has this technical difficulty.,3

All Trump all the Time,05/25/2018,Nature Ali,NPR just keeps repeating Trump talking points. White men are gunmen but brown people are terrorists. Tired of my beloved NPR just repeating right wing talking points instead of challenging completely obvious lies. Please return to being the Fourth Estate.,2
The Audio Distortion is Horrible!,06/04/2018,Cookie Monster Groupie,"Take note Apple or NPR audio engineers and/or Podcast Engineers: The signal of this podcast audio is ""too strong.""

Solid but lose the NPR ads- please.,05/06/2017,mej0017,I understand that ads are a fact of life on podcasts. And that's OK! You need to fund somehow and I don't mind a 30 second ad at the beginning. But PLEASE lose the NPR ads that you run for weeks at a time as the same ad. I like NPR and can find my own podcasts. I don't mind hearing ads sometimes if there is something new but the same ad every.single.time for weeks on a podcast this short is driving me insane.,3

Good But Repetitive,07/30/2017,djoalaska,"I really like keeping up with events and I really like the presentation and broadcasters, but I don't understand why some clips are played more than once. I subscribe and listen to all releases. I don't need to hear clips more than once.",5
Great news podcast!,09/22/2017,dadrizzle2,Great podcast,5
Good news content. Poor audio quality.,09/27/2017,Stagger Lee,"Minus two stars for very poor audio quality. Don't know if it's overprocessed or overcompressed but there are a lot of audible artifacts in your NPR News Now podcasts. Strangely, it seems louder than all other podcasts too. All these issues mean I have to turn the volume down to make it listenable. NPR knows how to create great sounding audio for broadcast and podcast. Why can't you do it for this one?",3
As a teacher,10/04/2017,DumpTrump2018,I have no difficulty recommending the unbiased and diligent reporting provided by NPR to everyone I come across who worries about trusting the media.,5
Perfect snippet of hourly news,10/05/2017,Mollyballsoup,"The most recent episode may not show up in iTunes Store, but when you subscribe to the podcast it will download an hourly 5min news update. You need to adjust your phone settings to look for new uploads (general podcast settings) at most hourly, or just swipe down on the homepage of your podcast app to get the most recent news podcast to appear. I love that it doesn‚Äôt clog your feed up or storage by keeping older episodes in its system. You can typically only download the most recent update of the hour.",5
How Rural Folk Get News,10/06/2017,Poecile,"It‚Äôs a great way to hear the news; short, sweet, and to the point. I‚Äôm so tired of talking head shows. This is the way to go! Thanks NPR!",5

Quick and consistent. Highly recommend.,10/16/2017,mackh278,"Excellent. It‚Äôs a part of my morning routine now. NPR is one of the few spots for legitimately good journalism. This 5 minute report cuts a lot of that great work out, but it‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre short on time and want the top stories quickly.",5
False News Network,10/17/2017,Ronnica44,NPR used to be really he best but has adopted a political agenda and now frequently reports false news. I will never listen to them again.,1

"OK, Jack Spear is a horrible newsreader in the world. Annoying ads.",11/20/2015,masterbluestar,"Super annoying full of advertising and marketing. Some of the newsreaders can barely read and speak (Jack Spear) or have speech impediments. Awful. Furthermore, it comes with really annoying ads and promotions. My twitchy finger is hovering near the delete button :)",2
Can't do without this podcast now,12/04/2015,Bendyeyes,I start my day every day with this podcast. It delivers the news I need to know in a short time so that even on the busiest days I know what's happening around the globe!,5
"Short, sweet, current world news",02/23/2016,Ccwhateva,"Quick blurbs of current news from all over the world. Updated daily. Good to listen to on the way to work, showering, or during lunch.",5
Leave More Than One Episode Up,03/07/2016,WKE066,NPR only leaves one episode up at a time. it would be nice if they left several hours worth of episodes up as i don't update my iTunes every hour.,2
Informative and Current,03/19/2016,Coral She-V,This is a quick little blurb. I have it setup to download the one most recent only. It's like having your assistant keeping you up to date on news affairs.,5
Still showing problems,04/18/2016,Jimpkkjhfss,"Podcast content is not bad but NPR still seems to have some technical problems. For example, the newscast for the past 4 days has been the exact same 5 minute summary just retitled. Not quite as bad as when the previous iteration (the 7am news summary) was discontinued without notice but frustrating nonetheless.",3
Love this podcast,04/21/2016,mlm0208,"Love this podcast!! I begin every day by listening to this podcast. It's a quick synopsis of what is going on, and it's an easy way to stay plugged in.",5
Perfect Bite-Sized Updates,05/06/2016,Map_41,"Honestly, I‚Äôm not religious about listening to these. They download and delete on the hour for me, so I don‚Äôt think about them when they‚Äôre gone. But when I need that little hit of what‚Äôs going on in the world, these are the best I could ask for.",5
Pretty decent quick update,06/19/2016,mhodgins,"I enjoy this app for quick news updates during the day.

My only gripe: it has ads for other NPR podcasts (which is OK), but they are at a super low volume. You either have to deal with barely audible speech for 25 seconds or turn up the volume and risk being blasted by the next podcast if you forget to turn it back down).",4
One of a kind,07/29/2016,GMeistro,This is the perfect podcast for a short update on what's going on during the day. My only wish would be for more news on international affairs.,5
Leave Each Epsiode Up Longer Than A Hour,08/04/2016,WKE066,There have been other hourly news updates and those channels have left the episodes up for at least 24 hours. Are that many people who update thei account every hour? If you are going through with the effort to post something leave it up for awhile.,1
Just Enough,10/12/2016,airandseabattle,Loving this podcast. Gives just enough news without going far too down the rabbit hole with opinion or junk pieces.,5

Not updating,09/07/2010,Ulkesh,[edit] NPR seems to have caught onto the problem and now the Hourly News Summary truly is hourly; it's updating properly now. Thank you NPR! [/edit],5
IslanderII,09/13/2010,IslanderII,Well done news summaries. But in the past several weeks technical problems have interrupted the podcast. Five Stars for content; recently One Star for reliability of service.,5

Slow hourly update,10/25/2011,Homeboy63,Always been great to have these podcasted updates but lately they have been several hours late to update.,3
Please update your podcasts,11/13/2011,Chuck512,"NPR: Please fix the update servers. Some of your podcasts, including this one, haven't been getting pushed out.
This is supposed to be an hourly news update. The 8 a.m. podcast is the latest one available. That's nine hours.",1
Please fix podcast update,11/21/2011,damselfly_h,"For the hourly news summary, it is 9 hours behind. Please look into that.",1
Please fix update problems,11/28/2011,WJB59,"The ""Hourly"" Updates via iPod v.5 are many hours old, while (simultaneous) via iTunes v10.5... downloads most recent hour most of the day, but does stop updating at times too.",2
"Even if You Subscribe, It's Still Late",02/20/2012,Verdant Cove,One often has to wait twenty minutes after the hour to get it. This is an issue separate from the outdated iTunes directories--this podcast goes out late to NPR's feed.,3
Day old news!,05/21/2012,Flofo 16,"I would love to be able to listen to this podcast on my way to work, but what's the point in listening to news that's a day old. Really have a hard time trying to figure out why NPR can't get their podcasts uploaded sooner. Very annoying.",1

Updates are now 3 days old,02/03/2013,Gffhvcdhjkgdcghfvsdigkddoddgg,I can't blame NPR for not updating this newsbrief every hour or day on weekends. But I don't understand how the most recent podcast to update is 3 days older than the one I had downloaded 2 days ago on same iPhone.,3
New Artwork,02/21/2013,phoenixbwp,"For the best use case, subscribe in iTunes, set checking to hourly, and enjoy. It may repeat, that's because there may not be new news to report. I also create a smart playlist and play it on my AppleTV along with other news podcasts.",4
Informative. Brief.,06/14/2014,Vin Caffrey,I enjoy this podcast for it keeping me up to date on all the happenings around the world!,5
NPR Hourly Newscast,11/13/2014,Lance Rulau,"Let's face it. Who has time to watch the news for more than a few seconds? We all read the headlines to catch up. Well, NPR Hourly Newscast is just that, a podcast of the headlines and a small synopsis of the story. It is every hour, and it is Excellent! Keep up the great work, NPR. For all those who actually work for a living, you save us all some time.",5
Lately: ad plays then nothing,12/07/2014,El_Benito,"I have listened to the NPR hourly news through iTunes for years, and loved it! But lately, the morning & weekend episodes do not play for me correctly when downloaded through the iTunes store. I get the advertisement of the day, then a squeaky ""fast forwarding"" noise, and then the rest of the podcast is silence. If I listen to the same podcast through Stitcher, it is okay. None of my other podcasts have this issue, so I presume it is a production issue with NPR so I am giving feedback.",1
"Great news, but lots of glitches",12/09/2014,Jbcartier,"The news you're going to get on here is fantastic. A brief summary of everything you need to know.
However, the podcast itself is plagued by glitches, which make it unreliable. Sometimes it won't update for a day or two. Sometimes it runs the ""sponsored by"" message for Story Corps and then cuts off, leaving silence for the rest of the 5 minutes.",3
What happened to the content?,12/09/2014,etgregoire,"I do like this podcast - however this one, along with many of the story of the day podcasts only have the Ad on the front end of the podcast with no content. It is even listed as being 12 seconds long. I have heard of people not having this problem with other podcast apps, but I am unable to load them on a work computer. I agree with the previous comment that this seems like a production issue that needs resolving.",1
Great snapshot of the world news,03/24/2015,RandyWe2,"NPR talks about the most up to date news both of the US and the world. This updates every hour, so you are always getting the latest news. There are zero advertisements. The segment usually goes five minutes, and gives no opinions.",5
Infrequent updates,08/11/2008,Tom Kfer,This podcast does not get updated all the time. It will go for 12-24 hours without an update. Not really good for an hourly news update podcast.,3
"Normally I am satisfied, but not this week...",11/06/2008,kanshefle,As historic (and wonderful) the election of Barack Obama is. I would expect to hear at least one mention of the frightening situation in Mexico right now.,4

Only complaint...,07/06/2009,Happydude996,"Is with the technical side of trying to listen to this podcast -- the news is great, but the podcast can be delayed from time to time. Oh, and where's my All Things Considered podcast?!",5
"Constant, Concise US News",07/23/2009,activescott,"The best constant source of US news. It is focused on US news and that's good (for a 5 min report). We just need a seperate one in exactly the same length, style, & quality focused on the rest of the world.",5
"Meaningful news, reported well",09/15/2009,DonKinAK,"NPR reporters give brief summaries of significant events in this hourly review. They omit tripe, the trite, and the meaningless. In the words of Detective Joe Friday of the Dragnet TV Series, ""All we want are the facts, ma'am.""",5
Still the Best US Newscasts...,09/30/2009,Sloper,...all things considered.,5

5 day old news......,02/15/2010,Mister Goat,Probably my most listened to podcast...until now. I find it hard to understand why a serious news organization like NPR News would suddenly stop updating an hourly newscast. Unprofessional.,1

Updates fine for me,04/17/2010,AdamPT,Never had a problem with the podcast not updating. Might have just been a fluke. Great podcast for a brief overview of news if you have 5 minuets and want a quick update. Obviously not comprehensive. Hard to complain about free.,5
This podcast is not updating,09/06/2010,luppymonster,It has a new date and time but it's the same podcast for at least 4 days! Has anyone else noticed this?,5
Had been good BUT MESSY LATELY,09/07/2010,weilander,"Had been listening to this podcast daily for a long time and loved it. However, it got worse in recent weeks. First, there was no podcast update for a few days a couple of weeks ago. And now the podcasts labeled current have the same content as the one from 5 days ago!! What's going on?

Needs a little tweaking,09/27/2006,Rugger1901,To help combat the problem of it absorbing all 16 hours since you left you computer i offer a few sources. first you set the podcast settings to allow you to manually refresh it when you need the podcast (this is what I do). Another way would be to go through and uncheck all the old hour summaries and set up you ipod to only accept checked podcasts. Another suggestion would be to go under podcast settings and have it update only the most recent ones. These are some suggestions that I can offer.,5
hourly news doesn't download hourly like it is supposed to,11/09/2006,chubearchgo,"I do like the news, unfortunatley the news doesn't always download hourly like they're supposed to and it would be nice to have a daily summary that's over 5 minutes",3
Use Applescript to Manage this Podcast,01/24/2007,Hedgeman,"Most of the time, I turn iTunes on and let it play throughout the day. An applescript called ""Play NPR News Summary"" you can download from the website ""Doug's Applescripts for Itunes"" makes this podcast very useful. It occasionaly checks for a new file, downloads it, and then plays it at the end of your next song. After it is over, it picks up whereever you left off in your playlist. This makes it very much like the hourly news summary you get on an NPR station and used to get on most commerical stations too. It would be great if the script erased the old files when it was over, but that isn't too much of an issue.",5
Refreshing when I hit refresh,03/04/2007,Girl600_podcast,"Whenever I update my podcast library for the day, I come over to the podcast and hit update to get the latest up to the hour news. Its so awesome how you put it out every hour. I appreciate this NPR.",5
Longer Daily News Summary Please!,10/31/2007,zenaorion,"I love NPR, but don't have enough bandwidth to listen live while I am out of the U.S. Please consider a podcast that it either ALL of Morning Edition, or 30 minutes+ of news and choice features. Thanks SO much!",5
When it's good it's very good,04/19/2008,sledneck907,"As of April 2008 NPR has had a hard time updating this podcast. Sometimes it does not post a new podcast for over 24 hours. Hardly current in the 21st century. On weekdays this podcast goes well with the NY Times Front Page, much like a bagel with brie. Mmmmmm, bagels.",5
